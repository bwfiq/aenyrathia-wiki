# House Rules
The games are run on a Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition ruleset (2014 PHB/DMG) with modifications as follows:
## Character Creation
- All characters receive an extra feat at 1st, 4th, 8th, 16th, and 20th level. Ability score improvement class features may not be used to take feats instead.
- You can choose to take the hacker's kit tool proficiency. The hacker's kit allows you to hack into computers, security systems, electronic locks, and other forms of digital networks and systems.
## Classes
- The Twilight Cleric's Channel Divinity: Twilight Sanctuary feature is changed from giving 1d6 temporary HP to a creature to giving it one use of damage reduction of an amount equal to the cleric's proficiency bonus plus their Wisdom modifier once per round
- The Psion Mystic Talent Iron Durability I is changed to give an AC of 13 + your Dexterity modifier instead of 13 + your Intelligence modifier.
## Spells
- Spell level changes:
	- Silvery Barbs and Id Insinuation are changed to 2nd level spells instead of 1st level spells.
## Miscellaneous
- Short rests take 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. Long rests take 1 week instead of 8 hours.
- Potions now take a bonus action to drink. You can use an action to drink any variant of a potion of healing to take the maximised result instead of rolling e.g. bonus action drink potion of healing -> heal 2d4+2 HP, action drink potion of healing -> heal 10 HP
