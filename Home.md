# Introduction
Aenyrathia is a contemporary fantasy setting that me and my friends play table top roleplaying games in. We define the setting as high magic and high fantasy with modern technology. That means that the typical species you would expect in a fantasy setting are present, like dwarves, elves, and gnomes, and all of these people see magic on an everyday basis, working and living in it.

1. [[Story So Far]] is a retelling of the campaign's events so far, organised into campaign session recaps and (soon) one-shots.
2. [[Characters]] are the notable people in the setting.
3. [[Lore]] contains detailed information about the setting's world, people, phenomena, and locations.
4. [[Player Resources]] explains what we use to play the game.
