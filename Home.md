# Introduction
Aenyrathia is a contemporary fantasy setting that me and my friends play tabletop roleplaying games in. The whole premise behind Aenyrathia is: how would a traditional high fantasy setting look like in the modern era?

To put this in more defined terms, the setting is high magic, high fantasy, and modern technology. That means that the typical species you would expect in a fantasy setting are present, like dwarves, elves, and gnomes, and all of these people see magic on an everyday basis, working and living in it.
