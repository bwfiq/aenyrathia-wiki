# Overview
Born on the 6th of Mistfall in the year 1875 in the forest of Alwahd, Phyrrah was born and raised in the Whiteapes, one of many wood elf tribes in said forest, located north east of Ilrinia. Though the majority of Alwahdian wood elves have a dislike for city folk, Phyrrah has always held an interest for the technology the Ilrinian anthropologists have brought with them to their tribal holdings in their frequent forays into the forest to study the tribes. 

In 1889, the city offered Phyrrah a scholarship as part of an outreach program to the tribes. She has since moved to the city and is currently a final year student in Arbalest Academy, on track to continuing her scholarship in a Council university studying software development after graduation.
# Physical Appearance
Phyrrah is a full blooded wood elf of the Whiteape tribe in her late teens. She stands taller than most her peers, and exhibits strong traits of her heritage by way of a light downing of white fur covering her body and a strong, muscular build.
