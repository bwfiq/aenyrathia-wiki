# Overview
Born on the 22nd of Lunaris in the year 1875, Rook is a 17 year old human male born and raised in the city of Ilrinia. Rook has little to no memories of his parents, who died when he was an infant. He was raised by his uncle, a chapter leader of the Front Libere gang, and lived in and among gang members as long as he can remember. 

In 1892, Rook discovered a small tunnel under a canal in the mostly abandoned Ham Row neighbourhood of Ilrinia, leading to a small underground nook containing half buried relics from the undercity of Ilrinia. Rook is currently in his final year of high school at Arbalest Academy and aspires to go to a university to study archaeology in an attempt to understand more about Ilrinia's undercity.
# Physical Appearance
Rook is a lanky human male in his late teens of average height with brown skin and blond spiky hair. Despite his young age, is covered in tattoos, ranging from gang insignia to runic symbols.
