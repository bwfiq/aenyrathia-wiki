# Overview
Born on the 3rd of Mistfall in the year 1875, Ekra is a 17 year old half-elf male. He was stillborn, but was brought back to life by his parents, a wood elf from the forest of Alwahd and a human botanist from Ilrinia, beseeching the gods for him to live. He has done well with his gift, spending the majority of his childhood under the mentorship of Varanggana Vanavichayen the Astral Fist, abbess of a renowned monastery in the Bear Mountains.

Ekra excelled in his monastic training, but ultimately did not achieve mastery due to his rival, Xerxes Fairchild, disrupting Ekra when he first tried to astral project. Ekra has been unable to achieve any semblance of astral projection since then, and thus has not achieved master status. His mentor took pity on him and sent him back to Ilrinia around four years ago, and Ekra has been attending high school at the Arbalest Academy since then.

Ekra is currently in his final year of high school, and lives a pretty easy going life. He mostly hangs out with his boyfriend Varris or with his childhood friends Arika and Shari, though recently he has started to spend more time with his schoolmates Rook, Fenrir, and Phyrrah. After they all ended up in detention on a Zymis, they got into a scuffle with a local gang to the neighbourhood called the Arbys. This has led to a few conflicts with the Arbys, and most recently while planning their strike back at them, has led to Fenrir dying in a mugging gone awry, though his body promptly had a new soul deposited in it albeit without any memories. Ekra feels responsible for this, and has taken it upon himself to take care of Ellipses, which is what the new soul inhabiting Fenrir's body calls himself.
# Physical Appearance
Ekra presents as a normal half-wood elf, which are common enough in the city of Ilrinia. He stands around 6 feet, and has a stockier build due to his years of monastic training and his time in Arbalest Academy's swim team. His wood elf heritage presents itself in the form of light mother-of-pearl scales covering his joints, radiating out from his sternum where a dense oval core of scales sits. Upon closer inspection, his divine nature is clear - his eyes intermittently flash pure white, his skin turns a reflective silvery grey in the sunlight, and a faint glowing aura emanates from him.
