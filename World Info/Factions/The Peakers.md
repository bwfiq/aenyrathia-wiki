# Overview
The Peakers are one of the most notorious gangs in the poorer areas of Mosskach, characterised by their refusal to stick to the common code of honour among thieves. They make their living by preying by the poor and downtrodden of Mosskach, holding many protection rackets. They are led by Ray Shelby, a portly gangster coming from old money.
