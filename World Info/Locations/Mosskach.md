# Overview
Mosskach is an independent city-state located on the eastern tip of Ibuth, the western continent, and is separated from Ilrinia by a narrow strait. While it operates under a nominal democracy, the city is effectively controlled by the powerful megacorporation EchoTech, which has established itself as the central force in the production and distribution of orichalcum-based magitech. This corporationâ€™s influence permeates every aspect of life in Mosskach, from industry to politics, reshaping the city into a hub of technological advancement often in conflict with its social fabric.

The majority of the city's population comprises humans and dwarves, who dominate its middle and upper classes. It's also known for the significant orc population, drawn from the tribal communities of Ibuth to serve as EchoTech's labour force. Unfortunately, many orcs find themselves marginalized, forced into the dilapidated areas of the city where discrimination is rampant. Despite this, they play an essential role in the city's ongoing modernization and have contributed greatly to its cultural tapestry.

## Rukh Zidul
Rukh Zidul is Mosskach's notorious slum area, where the city's socioeconomic inequalities manifest most starkly. Here, the orc population predominantly resides, facing systemic discrimination and poverty. Makeshift homes and crumbling tenements crowd the streets, which are often marred by crime. Though life is tough, the community exhibits resilience and camaraderie, organizing mutual aid groups and underground businesses that offer support to those in need. Daily life here is marked by struggle, but the spirit of the residents shines through in their vibrant street art and the annual Festivals of the Hollow, a celebration of culture and resistance amid adversity.
