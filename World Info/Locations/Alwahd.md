The sprawling jungle to the east of Ilrinia is named Alwahd, consisting of disparate wood elf tribes. The elves of Alwahd have warred against Ilrinia for centuries, but have recently settled down and allowed Ilrinian anthropologists to live in their villages and study them.

The wood elf tribes are each bestial in nature, and usually worship a patron animal, whose features each tribe embody in appearance.
