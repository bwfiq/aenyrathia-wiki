# Overview
Born as Luvia Bellona Ortlinde on the 12th of Lunaris 1875, Arche Kagekiyo was raised in the prestigious Ortlinde clan, known for their unparalleled craftsmanship in weaponry and their obsession with heroism and power. Her early years were filled with warmth and familial love, but after her younger brother, Taira, was kidnapped, leading to her mother falling into depression and her father obsessively pursuing power. Arche found solace in embracing the worship of the moon, a practise considered heretical, and when her father found her out, she ran away to Mosskach, adopting the name Arche Kagekiyo.

She stayed with her childhood friend Senzorin for a number of years, working with Zel'eon Talos at his clinic in the slums of Mosskach. After they got on the wrong side of EchoTech, they fled back to Ilrinia, forcing Arche back into the city where she was born. Arche is currently attending the Arbalest Academy as a final year high school student, and longs to reunite with her brother.
# Physical Appearance
Arche is a female sun elf in her late teens, standing at a height of 5'8". She keeps herself fit, but does not keep any muscle.  She has shoulder-length black hair styled in a wolf cut, and often wears a face mask. Arche carries a ceramic gun made by Zel'eon which she uses in her rituals to Ruatis.
