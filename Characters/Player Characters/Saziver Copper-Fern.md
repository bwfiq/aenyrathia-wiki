# Overview
Born on 3 Empyrea in the year 1875 in the city of Mosskach to a loving gnome couple, Saziver lived a sheltered and peaceful childhood. Saziver took after his mechanic mother and took apart anything he could get his hands on, to the chagrin of whoever the owner of the item was. Saziver was also raised by Both Steeljaw, a former professional Blood Bowl athlete turned sportscaster, whose publicist was Saziver's (other) mother. 

Saziver has recently developed psionic abilities, possibly as a result of exposure to Both, who has revealed himself to also have psionic abilities. He has just fled the city of Mosskach to the neighbouring Ilrinia, after him and Zel'eon Talos, Senzorin Talos, and Arche Kagekiyo got into trouble with the EchoTech corporation. Saziver hacked the database of a private school named Arbalest Academy, inserting the four of them as exchange students from Mosskach.
# Physical Appearance
Saziver is a male gnome in his late teens, with a wiry frame. He has an ash-brown complexion and copper hair, each inherited from a different parent. He has a distinct nervous energy about him and is constantly fidgeting with his hands or whatever is in them at that moment.
