###### Disarm:
- When Senzo hits a creature with a weapon attack, he can expend an Exploit Die to force it to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes additional damage equal to one roll of his Exploit Die, and it drops one item of his choice that it is currently holding on the ground in the space it is occupying.
###### Commanding Presence 
- When Senzo makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) check he can expend one Exploit Die, roll it, and add the result to his ability check. Senzo can do so after he rolls the d20, but before he knows if he succeeds. Also, whenever he would make a Charisma (Intimidation) check, he can make a Strength (Intimidation) check instead.

#### Cunning Strike
- When Senzo adds his Sneak Attack bonus to a damage roll, Senzo can forgo some of the bonus to use a Devious Exploit he knows without expending an Exploit Die, with the following rules: 
- It must be a Devious Exploit that he knows that can be used as part of a weapon attack.
- Senzo reduces his Sneak Attack bonus damage by a number of d6s equal to the degree of the Exploit
- If the Exploit normally deals additional damage, it does not deal any additional damage when used in this way.
 - For example, if he were to use this feature to use dirty hit as part of a Sneak Attack, Senzo would reduce his Sneak Attack bonus damage by 2d6 since dirty hit is a 2nd-degree Exploit, and dirty hit would not deal any additional damage to his target.
 - 
#### Uncanny Dodge
*5th level rogue feature*
- When an attacker that Senzo can see hits him with an attack, Senzo can use his reaction to halve the attack's damage against him.

#### Soothing Speech 
*5th level Swashbuckler Exploit*
- As an action, Senzo can expend an Exploit Die and attempt to soothe the emotions of any creature that can both hear and understand him within 20 feet, forcing them to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, for the next 10 minutes, creatures become indifferent toward creatures of his choice that they are currently hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the effect ends, the creature becomes hostile again.

#### Glancing Blow 
*5th level Swashbuckler Exploit*
- When you make a melee weapon attack and miss, you can expend an Exploit Die to immediately repeat your attack against another target within the reach of your weapon.
