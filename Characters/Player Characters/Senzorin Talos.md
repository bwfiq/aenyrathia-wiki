# Overview
Born on 3 Empyrea in the year 1875 in the city of Ilrinia, Senzorin is a product of two different worlds. His mother, a sun elf high society business woman, and his father, a human bartender, raised Senzorin under the yoke of the Talos clan doctrine. They expected Senzorin to live up to the standard set by the rest of the clan, but the pressure was too much for him. At the age of ten, he ran away to the neighbouring city of Mosskach, abandoning his family.

The next few years were a whirlwind for Senzorin - first living as an urchin on the crime ridden streets of Mosskach, he was soon recruited into a gang and made to sell dwarven mined drugs. He soon picked himself up a mentor in the form of Einrow Whitebeard, a former pirate captain who has blood ties to the gang. Einrow had turned to a life of burglary after getting bored of the high seas, and took Senzorin under his wing, teaching him the trade.

In 1891, on Senzorin's 16th birthday, Einrow passed while on a burglary gone awry. A fatally wounded Einrow stumbles into a bar to find Senzorin and gifts him a revolver, before passing on in Senzorin's arms. Senzorin continued his life as a burglar, though without much use for the riches he gathered, redistributed them among the poorer citizens of his neighbourhood in Mosskach. He spent most of his days whiling away time, not doing much else other than burglary, though he began to spend some time studying folklore in Mosskach's public libraries, intrigued by tales of the Goddess of Darkness.

In 1892, Senzorin and his friends, Zel'eon, Arche, and Saziver, got into serious trouble with the EchoTech corporation after stealing one of their experimental chips. The four fled to Ilrinia, where they have enrolled into Arbalest Academy.

# Physical Appearance
Senzorin Talos is a sun elf male in his late teens of average height and physique. He bears a distinct knife scar on his right eye as a result of defying orders in his time as a gang member. His shoulder length hair is gold in colour, but he dyes it black to avoid people guessing at his sun elf heritage.
