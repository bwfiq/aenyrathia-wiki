# Overview
Born on the 22nd of Chronos to the Talos family, a sun elf clan specialising in car manufacturing, Zel'eon faced a severe condition: his arm was necrotising, threatening to take over the rest of his body. His mother cut off the necrotising arm, saving him, but the rest of the family kicked Zel'eon and his mother out for fear of how the crippled boy would affect their family name. Zel'eon's mother fled to Mosskach with the young Zel'eon, and started a small clinic in the slums.

After his mother passed when he was a young teenager, Zel'eon took over the clinic, treating patients who had nowhere else to go, including gang members. He learned the basics of combat from his orc patients, finding a love for sparring from them. He also took on two trainees, an ex-gangster named Maria, and Arche Kagekiyo, a young woman of Zel's age who had barely any social skills.

Zel'eon has recently fled to Ilrinia after getting on the wrong side of EchoTech with Arche and two others, named Saziver and Senzorin. He is currently attending Arbalest Academy with them, slowly letting his guard down in the relative safety of Ilrinia.

  Your insights into magical and mechanical objects can appear as magic to the untrained eye. Starting from 1st level, you can use tinker's tools to cast the mending Cantrip and both detect magic and identify as rituals. Your tools are the spellcasting focus and replace the material components of the spells.
  Moreover, the time it would take you to craft a magic item is halved if you are proficient with appropriate artisan's tools.
- Replicate Magic Item:
  You can also use your Infusions to replicate magic items you have studied. During a long rest, you can spend 1 hour using tinker's tools to examine a magic item you touch. At the end of that long rest, you can replace one Infusion you know with the knowledge of this magic item. After which, you can infuse an object with the properties of that magic item, following all the rules for your other Infusions.
  You cannot use this feature to replicate magic items that are consumed after one use, such as scrolls and potions.
  You can use this feature to replicate any item of Common rarity. As you gain Artificer levels you can use this feature to replicate items of increasing rarity: Uncommon at 5th level, Rare at 11th level, and finally Very Rare items at 17th level.
- Infusions:
  You have learned to imbue objects with your signature brand of magic in order to produce wondrous items. At 1st level, you learn two Infusions of your choice from the list at the end of this class. The Infusions Known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn additional Infusions. You cannot learn an Infusion more than once unless specified. During each long rest, you can spend 1 hour using tinker's tools to replace one Infusion you know with another Infusion of your choice, so long as you meet all of its prerequisites.

    and arcane enhancements. Your body itself counts as individual items for the purposes of Infusions: your
    head (helmet), torso (armor), arms (gauntlets), and legs (boots). Each of these body parts can bear one Infusion.
    These modifications have also hardened your exterior.
    If you are not wearing armor, your Armor Class is equal to
