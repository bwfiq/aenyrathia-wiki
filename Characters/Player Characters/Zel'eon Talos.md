# Overview
Born on the 22nd of Chronos to the Talos family, a sun elf clan specialising in car manufacturing, Zel'eon faced a severe condition: his arm was necrotising, threatening to take over the rest of his body. His mother cut off the necrotising arm, saving him, but the rest of the family kicked Zel'eon and his mother out for fear of how the crippled boy would affect their family name. Zel'eon's mother fled to Mosskach with the young Zel'eon, and started a small clinic in the slums.

After his mother passed when he was a young teenager, Zel'eon took over the clinic, treating patients who had nowhere else to go, including gang members. He learned the basics of combat from his orc patients, finding a love for sparring from them. He also took on two trainees, an ex-gangster named Maria, and Arche Kagekiyo, a young woman of Zel's age who had barely any social skills.

Zel'eon has recently fled to Ilrinia after getting on the wrong side of EchoTech with Arche and two others, named Saziver and Senzorin. He is currently attending Arbalest Academy with them, slowly letting his guard down in the relative safety of Ilrinia.
