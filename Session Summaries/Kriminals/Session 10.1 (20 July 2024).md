## The Offices of the Purists

On the 23rd of Mistfall 1892, Zel'eon and Arche stand in the offices of the Purists after defeating their leader, Thibault Carroway. They realize the extent of the slaughter they had performed, with Arche feeling a twinge of disappointment through her link with Ruatis. Nevertheless, they begin searching the building for clues regarding the Purists' motivations and their involvement in the terrorist attack on the New Dawn the previous day.

In Thibault's office, they find his spellbook, journal, and a ledger detailing the finances of the Purists. The spellbook seems of no immediate use, so they stash it and focus on the journal and ledger. The ledger reveals that the Purists had been steadily losing funds and members since their formation, with a series of anonymous cash transfusions starting three months ago and lasting two months being the only notable entry. Thibault's journal mentions a person named Celeste, valuable to the organization, though no women were encountered during their raid.

Zel'eon finds a treasure trove of alchemical supplies in the artificer's workshop, including a recipe for synthesizing alchemical fire and tools for creating and maintaining golems. Meanwhile, Arche searches the meeting room on the second floor and finds a large locked cabinet and a potions case. After Senzorin picks the padlock on the cabinet, Arche finds that the cabinet still resists any attempt to open it. Realising there must be some sort of ward protecting it from being opened, she begins devising a spell to reverse the enchantment while the rest finish searching the building.

On the first floor, the group finds reconnaissance documents on multiple magitech companies within Ilrinia, Lyra Valen's estate, and even EchoTech's operations in Mosskach. These documents, however, detail incoherent plans to sabotage or assault these locations. Zel'eon, noticing at this point that Senzorin is barely standing on his feet, sends him off with Ellipses to get some rest. He heads upstairs with Saziver, noticing Arche putting the final touches on her spell.

The cabinet swings open to reveal a mannequin dressed in a black bodysuit with silvery metal armour plates sewn in. Arche, recognizing the metal as mithril, tries on the suit and finds it almost fits her perfectly. Wearing the mithril body armour under her regular clothes, Arche heads out of the building onto the now empty street. The group leaves in their rented car, taking the unconscious Thibault Carroway to Lyra's estate.

Arriving at Lyra's estate under the light of the new moon, they inform her of the situation. Lyra is shocked at the sight of Thibault and bids the party come in for an explanation. They skirt around the fact that they killed the rest of the Purists, and Lyra tells them to head back home while she deals with the situation. The party returns to their house in Arbalest, exhausted from the day, and get a good night's rest.
## Arche's Crisis

Arche enlists Zel'eon, who makes a call to Dalen Blackwell to see if he can help them get to the rooftop of the Peak, a skyscraper owned by the Sylvan corporation. He tells them he doesn't have quite as much sway as they assumed, but he could get them a meeting with someone in Sylvan. Indeed, as they are on the way to the Peak, they receive a message from Dalen telling them they have a meeting with an Arthur Truges, an executive in Sylvan.

Heading into the Peak, Arche and Zel'eon speak to the receptionist and are directed to Arthur's office on the 80th floor. Speaking to the executive, they find that the only way they can convince him to get access to the rooftop is to help him out with something he needs; hunting a beast called the Storm Serpent, sacred to a tribe of wood elves in the jungle of Alwahd. Knowing that she was on a time limit to complete the ritual by midnight, Arche convinced Arthur to provide transport, as well as some equipment that would help them hunt the Storm Serpent. 

Zel'eon and Arche head back down to the first floor of the Peak, finding an awaiting helicarrier with accompanying pilot. They pile in, finding a bag of holding, two insulating suits as well as a split bladed sword, requested by Arche. The transport takes them over the city's skyline, depositing them on the edge of the jungle. They slowly make their way through the vegetation, finding charred trees and electrified puddles, as the sky got darker around them and the ambient static electricity levels slowly increased.

Eventually, the pair comes upon a large, ancient tree hollow that is surrounded by the electrified puddles that have become common on their hunt. Arche suddenly spots two silver eyes staring at them from the underbrush and tells Zel'eon to freeze. The two get ready, Zel'eon unfurling his wings, as they prepare for battle.

Arche channels the power of the new moon as she and Zel'eon do battle with the Storm Serpent, a titanic snake with silvery, iridescent scales that did its utmost to strike the pair down with strikes of elemental lightning and thunderclaps. The pair does eventually prevail, striking the serpent down and decapitating it. Realising the elves that worship it are sure to investigate soon, they begin carving the serpent's corpse into as small pieces as will fit in their provided bag of holding. 

As they finish stuffing the carved bits of the serpent into the bag, Arche hears sounds coming from the side of the clearing. She quickly tosses a potion of invisibility to Zel'eon, who drinks it and disappears from view, and disappears herself into the underbrush, watching as a small group of wood elves emerge into the clearing. She hears them call out for the storm serpent, but to no avail. Fleeing back to the helicarrier, she hears the keening of the elves, calling out for their missing god. 
### The Ritual

Zel'eon and Arche arrive back at the Peak, heading up to Arthur Truges' office and handing him the bag of holding. As promised, he tells them to head up to the 264th story for rooftop access. As the pair ride the elevator up to the roof, they emerge to a stunning sight; even higher than they were on the helicarrier, they see the new moon shining above them. Arche begins setting up the ritual, drawing the ritual circle out of chalk and moon dust. She kneels at the centre of the circle, and asks Zel'eon to begin.

Zel'eon takes his surgical tools out and heats them with his implants, sterilising them. He steps towards Arche and begins cutting into her left eyeball, extracting it and severing her left optic nerve. He does the same with her right eyeball, as Arche stays kneeling, not even flinching at the pain. As soon as her eyes are removed, she looks up at the moon, seeing it even without vision. She begins beseeching Ruatis, and Zel'eon watches as moonlight begins pooling in her eye sockets, shining out into the night sky. 

As the light fades, he watches as the moonlight coalesces into orbs of silver light inscribed with a symbol - the elvish rune for moon. Arche looks at him and places a hand on his shoulder. Zel'eon looks out at the city skyline and realises he can see in the darkness. Arche turns and looks back towards the centre of the rooftop, where they came from. Zel'eon, turning to see what she is looking at, sees a figure in all white walking towards them. 

As this figure gets closer, it becomes obvious that it is Ruatis. Appearing as a vaguely elvish looking woman dressed in a silvery white gown, she approaches Arche and speaks with her briefly, calling Arche her prophet and telling her to continue her mission and spread word of Ruatis. Ruatis also tells Arche to conduct herself as a prophet would, and to not diminish Ruatis' name among the people of Aenyrathia.

As the goddess disappears, Arche and Zel'eon are left by themselves on the rooftop, alone. Without much further discussion, Zel'eon picks up Arche and unfurls his wings. Stepping off the edge of the rooftop, he glides down, over the city of Ilrinia, landing back at home.
