# Session Recap
## Reconvening at the House
On Udis, the first day of the weekend, the sun hung low in the sky on the 27th of Mistfall, 1892, casting golden rays across the city of Ilrinia. Zel'eon and Senzorin returned to their home after their heist at the Platinum Tower. Senzorin, unable to contain his exhaustion any longer, collapsed onto the couch, the upholstery sinking beneath him.

A short while later, the front door swung open, and Arche stepped inside, her face a mask of fatigue. She had just returned from a date with Jack, a student from Miskatonic University, and it was clear to the others that the outing had not gone well. Without hesitation, she sank down onto the couch beside Senzorin, who shifted slightly but offered her no words of comfort.

From upstairs, the sounds of studying drifted down the hallway as Saziver remained entrenched in preparing for their upcoming exams. Zel’eon called for him and moments later, Saziver appeared at the top of the staircase, his eyes wide from the countless energy drinks he had consumed today. He slowly walked down the stairs, joining the rest in the living room.

As Arche recounted the evening with Jack, a realisation began to dawn on the rest. She kept referring to him as merely a friend making her friends realise she had not realised it was even a date. The teasing began as Arche's cheeks flushed with embarrassment upon her friends' reactions. In an effort to regain some dignity, she mentioned that Jack had surprisingly dropped an "I love you" during the evening, which only further fueled their playful jabs.

Zel'eon and Senzorin talked about what they had been up to, describing the events of their heist. As they spoke, Saziver’s expression grew anxious at the recklessness of their actions. The two young men also told the rest of the team about their most recent sparring session, where, surprisingly, they had discovered they had some latent magical abilities.

Curiosity piqued, Saziver demanded a demonstration. Comfortably sprawled on the couch in his boxers, Senzorin obliged, pulling out his revolver and showing it was unloaded by popping out its bullet cylinder. Senzorin began to concentrate as lines of runic energy began to swirl around the barrel of the revolver, coalescing into a bolt of elemental fire at the tip of the barrel. It shot forth from the weapon, illuminating the room in flickering light, much to the astonishment of Arche and Saziver. 

They were previously aware of his limited telekinesis and telepathy which seemed incongruent with his new ability. Saziver’s mind, still in study mode, suggested the revolver might be enchanted or some kind of magitech. Senzorin simply shrugged, saying he just shoots the damn thing. Arche chimed in, noting that Senzorin would save a fortune on bullets, before asking about the origins of the weapon. Senzorin told them about his mentor, Einrow, who had gifted him the revolver right before he died.

At this point, Zel’eon proposed they set to work replacing the engine of their vintage Talos Sovereign with the one they had liberated from Victor Ralston’s vehicle. Saziver eagerly accepted, exclaiming that he was the perfect height to pass him tools.

Entering the garage, they saw their two vehicles: the dilapidated Talos Sovereign, a remnant of their flight from Mosskach, and Senzorin's pride, his chopper that had belonged to Einrow. Zel’eon set to work on the engine, assisted by Saziver, while Arche invoked a spell of guidance to enhance their efforts, before finally the engine roared to life.

The four of them piled into the newly restored Talos, while Senzorin took to his motorcycle. Setting out for an early dinner, they emerged onto the suburban streets of Arbalest, where families milled about, enjoying the weekend.

As they sped down the road, Senzorin spotted Ellipses in his garden and couldn’t resist a shout, demanding, “Where's my plants?” before they sped off into the evening. Senzorin proposed dining at the Iron Horse Tavern, but Arche playfully declared her intentions to cast Purify Food and Drink on his beers to render them harmless. Senzorin's retort was immediate. “I’ll beat your motherfucking ass under the table.” Ultimately, they settled on Tom’s Diner in the district of Greenwich.
