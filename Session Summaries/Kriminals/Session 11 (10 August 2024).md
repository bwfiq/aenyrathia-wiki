# Session Recap
## Reconvening at the House
On Udis, the first day of the weekend, the sun hung low in the sky on the 27th of Mistfall, 1892, casting golden rays across the city of Ilrinia. Zel'eon and Senzorin returned to their home after their heist at the Platinum Tower. Senzorin, unable to contain his exhaustion any longer, collapsed onto the couch, the upholstery sinking beneath him.

Moments later, the front door swung open, and Arche stepped inside, her face revealing just how draining her evening had been. She had recently returned from a date with Jack, a student from Miskatonic University, and it was evident that the outing had not gone as she had hoped. Without a second thought, she sank down beside Senzorin on the couch, who shifted slightly but offered her no words of comfort.

From upstairs, the sounds of studying drifted down the hallway as Saziver remained deep into his exam preparations. Zel’eon called for him and moments later, Saziver appeared at the top of the staircase, his eyes wide from the countless energy drinks he had consumed today. He slowly walked down the stairs, joining the rest in the living room.

As Arche recounted her evening with Jack, a realization dawned on her friends. She kept calling him "just a friend," revealing that she hadn’t fully grasped that it was indeed a date. The atmosphere shifted as playful teasing erupted, heating Arche's cheeks with embarrassment in response to their reactions.

Zel'eon and Senzorin talked about what they had been up to, describing the events of their heist. As they spoke, Saziver’s expression grew anxious at the recklessness of their actions. The two young men also told the rest of the team about their most recent sparring session, where, surprisingly, they had discovered they had some latent magical abilities.

Curiosity piqued, Saziver demanded a demonstration. Senzorin obliged, pulling out his revolver and showing it was unloaded by popping out its bullet cylinder. As he concentrated, lines of runic energy began to swirl around the barrel, coalescing into a flickering bolt of elemental fire at the tip. It shot forth from the weapon, illuminating the room in flickering light, much to the astonishment of Arche and Saziver. 

They were previously aware of his limited telekinesis and telepathy which seemed incongruent with his new ability. Saziver’s mind, still in study mode, suggested the revolver might be enchanted or some kind of magitech. Senzorin simply shrugged, stating, “I just shoot the damn thing.” Arche chimed in, noting that Senzorin would save a fortune on bullets, before asking about the origins of the weapon. He explained that it had been a gift from his mentor, Einrow, just before his death as a result of stealing the revolver.

At this point, Zel’eon proposed they set to work replacing the engine of their vintage Talos Sovereign with the one they had liberated from Victor Ralston’s vehicle. Saziver eagerly accepted, exclaiming that he was the perfect height to pass him tools.

Entering the garage, they surveyed their two vehicles: the dilapidated Talos Sovereign, a remnant of their hurried escape from Mosskach, and Senzorin's pride, his chopper previously owned by Einrow. Zel'eon set to work on the engine while Saziver assisted, and Arche invoked a spell of guidance to bolster their efforts. At last, the engine roared to life, probably for the first time in decades.

The four of them piled into the newly restored Talos, while Senzorin took to his motorcycle. Setting out for an early dinner, they emerged onto the suburban streets of Arbalest, where the neighbourhood's families milled about, enjoying the weekend.

As they sped down the road, Senzorin spotted Ellipses in his garden and couldn’t resist shouting, “Where's my plants?” before they rode off. Senzorin suggested dining at the Iron Horse Tavern, but Arche playfully threatened to cast Purify Food and Drink on his beers, rendering them non-alcoholic. Senzorin’s retort came swiftly: “I’ll beat your motherfucking ass under the table.” In the end, they settled on Tom’s Diner in Greenwich.
## Tom's Diner
As the restored Talos Sovereign hummed under the bright lights of the setting sun, the group rolled into a residential neighborhood of Greenwich. As they passed under some train tracks, the team pulled into a cul-de-sac graced with an assortment of shops and eateries. Among these stood a classic diner, its vibrancy encapsulated in red and white decor, proudly boasting the simple sign: **Tom’s Diner**.

As they settled into a booth, the aroma of fried chicken and waffles enveloped them. They ordered their food using the touchscreens embedded in the tablet on their table. but a sudden sight caught their attention. Across the diner, they saw Jonathan Ralston and Jack—Arche’s unremarkable “date”—with two other Miskatonic University students, all decked out in their university sweaters.

Jonathan, filled the air with laughter as he joked with his friends, his long black hair falling down over his sharp, preppy Caucasian features. In stark contrast sat Jack, much more average looking and not really participating in the conversation, seeming down over his date with Arche earlier that day. Two half-elf women accompanied them, a blonde with emerald green eyes talking animatedly with Jonathan, and her black-haired friend with more East Asian looking features.

“Isn’t he your friend?” Senzorin quipped with a knowing smile, as Saziver began to notice an odd look on Arche's face, signalling she was not being very forthcoming about the date.

 In a bid to regain some dignity, Arche mentioned that Jack had unexpectedly dropped an "I love you" during their outing. As the rest of the group stared at her in incredulity, Arche threw up her hands in exasperation. “Who does that?”

Just then, Senzorin noticed the group of Miskatonic University students looking over at them. He begins talking to his friends about how good Jonathan looks, as well as his two half-elf female friends. Arche is staring daggers at Senzorin, as Saziver looks over at the group looking at them, realising that the blonde half-elf girl is leant over, whispering to Jack, "Isn't that the girl who kept calling you a friend?", to which Saziver giggles to himself. He keeps reading their lips as Senzorin and Arche continues arguing, finding that Jack is telling his friends about how he brought Arche to a fancy place for their date but Arche kept saying it was the best friend outing she had ever been on.

At this point, Arche looks away from Senzorin and notices that Jack and his friends are staring at them, and instantly casts a spell to teleport out to the car that they parked in front of the diner. The rest notice Arche's disappearance and look out the window to see her hiding in the backseat of the car.

Zel'eon and Senzorin decide to approach Jack and his friends. Saziver briefly freaks out at this, but they ignore him, proceeding towards them. Senzorin makes a beeline for Jonathan, saying flirtily, "Hey, John." Jonathan greets him warmly and they talk for a little bit as the half-elf girls giggle about Jonathan and Senzorin, clearly knowing about their passionate date last night.

Jack at this point is trying to make himself as small as possible to not get noticed, but Zel'eon greets him and introduces themselves. They get the names of Jack and Jonathan's friends, finding that the blonde is named Gemma and the black haired girl is named K'Lai. Zel'eon brings up the date with Arche to Jack and his face falls. Senzorin and Zel'eon reassure Jack that he dodged a bullet with Arche since she is weird and schizophrenic, and Jack kinda is weirded out by her friends telling him that.

Jonathan switches the topic of conversation, inviting Senzorin out for drinks later with his group later that night. Senzorin deflects slightly, telling him he might join and he'll text Jonathan. Zel'eon, Saziver, and Senzorin walk back out to the car, joining Arche. Senzorin tells Arche to never go near a boy again, calling her not only a heartbreaker, but a soulbreaker.

As this is happening, Zel'eon gets a text from Dalen Blackwell talking about a meeting to discuss Zel'eon's newfound magical ability. Dalen Blackwell, although being a bit older than the group (around mid 30s) texts in Gen Z slang, which makes the group titter a little bit.

As they pull out from the cul-de-sac under the setting sun, they decide to head to Arbalest Academy to spar for a bit before heading home.
