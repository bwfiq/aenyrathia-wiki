# Session Recap
## Reconvening at the House
On Udis, the first day of the weekend, the sun hung low in the sky on the 27th of Mistfall, 1892, casting golden rays across the city of Ilrinia. Zel'eon and Senzorin returned to their home after their heist at the Platinum Tower. Senzorin, unable to contain his exhaustion any longer, collapsed onto the couch, the upholstery sinking beneath him.

Moments later, the front door swung open, and Arche stepped inside, her face revealing just how draining her evening had been. She had recently returned from a date with Jack, a student from Miskatonic University, and it was evident that the outing had not gone as she had hoped. Without a second thought, she sank down beside Senzorin on the couch, who shifted slightly but offered her no words of comfort.

From upstairs, the sounds of studying drifted down the hallway as Saziver remained deep into his exam preparations. Zel’eon called for him and moments later, Saziver appeared at the top of the staircase, his eyes wide from the countless energy drinks he had consumed today. He slowly walked down the stairs, joining the rest in the living room.

As Arche recounted her evening with Jack, a realization dawned on her friends. She kept calling him "just a friend," revealing that she hadn’t fully grasped that it was indeed a date. The atmosphere shifted as playful teasing erupted, heating Arche's cheeks with embarrassment in response to their reactions.

Zel'eon and Senzorin talked about what they had been up to, describing the events of their heist. As they spoke, Saziver’s expression grew anxious at the recklessness of their actions. The two young men also told the rest of the team about their most recent sparring session, where, surprisingly, they had discovered they had some latent magical abilities.

Curiosity piqued, Saziver demanded a demonstration. Senzorin obliged, pulling out his revolver and showing it was unloaded by popping out its bullet cylinder. As he concentrated, lines of runic energy began to swirl around the barrel, coalescing into a flickering bolt of elemental fire at the tip. It shot forth from the weapon, illuminating the room in flickering light, much to the astonishment of Arche and Saziver. 

They were previously aware of his limited telekinesis and telepathy which seemed incongruent with his new ability. Saziver’s mind, still in study mode, suggested the revolver might be enchanted or some kind of magitech. Senzorin simply shrugged, stating, “I just shoot the damn thing.” Arche chimed in, noting that Senzorin would save a fortune on bullets, before asking about the origins of the weapon. He explained that it had been a gift from his mentor, Einrow, just before his death as a result of stealing the revolver.

At this point, Zel’eon proposed they set to work replacing the engine of their vintage Talos Sovereign with the one they had liberated from Victor Ralston’s vehicle. Saziver eagerly accepted, exclaiming that he was the perfect height to pass him tools.

Entering the garage, they surveyed their two vehicles: the dilapidated Talos Sovereign, a remnant of their hurried escape from Mosskach, and Senzorin's pride, his chopper previously owned by Einrow. Zel'eon set to work on the engine while Saziver assisted, and Arche invoked a spell of guidance to bolster their efforts. At last, the engine roared to life, probably for the first time in decades.

The four of them piled into the newly restored Talos, while Senzorin took to his motorcycle. Setting out for an early dinner, they emerged onto the suburban streets of Arbalest, where the neighbourhood's families milled about, enjoying the weekend.

As they sped down the road, Senzorin spotted Ellipses in his garden and couldn’t resist shouting, “Where's my plants?” before they rode off. Senzorin suggested dining at the Iron Horse Tavern, but Arche playfully threatened to cast Purify Food and Drink on his beers, rendering them non-alcoholic. Senzorin’s retort came swiftly: “I’ll beat your motherfucking ass under the table.” In the end, they settled on Tom’s Diner in Greenwich.
## Tom's Diner
The group soon pulled into a quaint cul-de-sac where a classic diner stood out, its vibrant red and white decor gleaming with a simple sign that read: **Tom’s Diner**.

Settling into a booth, the aroma of fried chicken and waffles enveloped the group. They ordered their meals from the sleek touchscreens embedded within the table, but were interrupted as Senzorin’s gaze landed on a familiar sight across the diner. There sat Jonathan Ralston, a boy Senzorin was dating, and Jack—Arche’s unremarkable "date"—with two other Miskatonic University students.

Jonathan’s laughter filled the air, each chuckle laced with confidence, his long black hair cascading over his sharp, preppy features as he joked with his companions. In stark contrast, Jack sat uneasily, an average-looking figure overshadowed by Jonathan's charisma, seemingly lost in thoughts of their earlier encounter with Arche. With them were two half-elf women: a blonde with emerald green eyes who spoke animatedly with Jonathan, and a black-haired girl with East Asian features who observed quietly.

“Isn’t that your friend?” Senzorin teased, a sly grin breaking across his face as he looked at Arche. At the same moment, Saziver began to notice an odd expression on Arche’s face—one that suggested she was not entirely forthcoming about her date with Jack.

In a bid to reclaim some dignity amidst the teasing, she said, “Well, he did drop an ‘I love you’ during our outing.” As her words hung in the air, incredulity washed over her friends, their expressions morphing into a mixture of surprise and humor. “Who does that?” she exclaimed, throwing her hands up in exasperation.

Just then, Senzorin saw the group glancing over in their direction. “Jonathan looks kind of good, though...” making Arche shoot daggers at him. Saziver, who had turned his attention to the other table, caught the blonde half-elf leaning in close to Jack. “Isn’t that the girl who kept calling you a friend?” she whispered. Amused, Saziver stifled a giggle as he continued to read their lips.

Jack, embarrassed, began recounting the outing to Jonathan and their friends. “I brought her to this fancy place,” he said, a hint of despair creeping into his voice, “but she just kept saying it was the best friend outing ever.” 

Suddenly, Arche turned to catch sight of Jack and his friends staring at them. A rush of unfathomable embarrassment coursed through her, and in a desperate attempt to escape, she cast a spell to teleport out to the Talos, parked just outside the diner. The rest of her friends glanced out the window in confusion, quickly spotting Arche, now awkwardly crunched in the backseat, her cheeks flushed.

At this, Zel’eon and Senzorin got up to approach Jack and his companions. Saziver's eyes widened in alarm, but the pair paid no mind to him. Senzorin made a beeline for Jonathan calling out to him, “Hey, John,”. Jonathan’s face brightened, as the half-elf girls giggled at their interaction, clearly aware of the pair's recent history.

Jack was trying his best to sink into the cushions of the booth, but Zel’eon leaned around Jonathan and greeted him. He introduced himself to the group, getting the names of Jack's friends: Gemma, the blonde, and K'Lai, the dark-haired girl. 

Before long, Zel’eon casually mentioned the date with Arche, prompting the color to drain from Jack's face. Jack grew more and more uncomfortable as Zel'eon and Senzorin began telling him he dodged a bullet with Arche, describing their friend as weird and schizophrenic.

Redirecting the conversation, Jonathan turned to Senzorin, inviting him out for drinks with his group later that evening. Not wanting to commit to any plans, Senzorin deflected the invitation, promising he would send a text later. 

After the brief exchange, Zel’eon, Saziver, and Senzorin wandered back out to the car where Arche awaited. “You better stay away from boys from now on,” Senzorin teased her. “You’re not just a heartbreaker; you’re a soulbreaker!”

Amidst the ribbing, Zel’eon received a text from Dalen Blackwell regarding a meeting to discuss his newfound magical ability as an artificer. Though Dalen was a bit older—roughly in his mid-thirties—his messaging contained contemporary Gen Z slang that sent a wave of amusement through the group.

As they pulled away from the diner under the soft glow of the fading sun, they decided to head to Arbalest Academy for some sparring before returning home.
## Zel'eon and Arche Spar
On Udis, the first day of the weekend on the 27th of Mistfall, 1892, Zel'eon and Senzorin returned home after their successful heist at the Platinum Tower, where Senzorin collapsed in exhaustion and Arche arrived looking drained after a disappointing date with Jack. As Saziver joined them from his intense studying, Arche's remarks about Jack sparked playful teasing from her friends, highlighting her reluctance to acknowledge the date. Senzorin demonstrated his newfound magical ability by conjuring a bolt of fire from his revolver, surprising his friends. The group then decided to replace the engine of their vintage Talos Sovereign, successfully bringing it to life. They headed out for a meal at Tom's Diner, where they unexpectedly encountered Jonathan, Senzorin's date, along with Jack and his friends. Light-hearted banter continued until Arche, feeling embarrassed, teleported back to their vehicle, while Zel'eon and Senzorin engaged with Jack's group. The outing ended with more teasing about Arche's dating misadventures, and they resolved to visit Arbalest Academy for sparring before returning home, buoyed by their camaraderie and successes.

- As the group arrives at Arbalest Academy, they head to the field behind the school. Senzorin and Saziver set up lawn chairs as they watch Zel'eon and Arche prepare to spar against one another as the moon rises.
- Arche is wearing her black mask along with her black mithril plated bodysuit, while Zel'eon is just wearing a white shirt and black pants without his normal jacket.
- Zel'eon extends his wings wide, and lunges forward, slashing across Arche's chest with his arm blade. Frosty ice begins forming over the slash, as Arche jumps back. With her left hand outstretched, a spear of pure moonlight begins to appear in said hand, as she lunges forward and attacks Zel'eon twice, once with her sword and once with the conjured spear.
- Saziver and Senzorin watch the fight, alongside one of the school janitors who has stopped cleaning the outside of the school to watch the fight.
- As Zel'eon is blown back by Arche's barrage of attacks, he extends his right wing, stabilising himself, before attacking once again with his arm blade, trailed by a wave of ice through the air. Arche once again lunges forward, piercing the spiritual weapon in her left hand towards Zel'eon's chest, piercing through it.
- Senzorin is ignoring the fight completely, focusing on the janitor watching the fight. Zel'eon reaches out with his hand, crackling with a blue electric energy, and touches Arche on one of the metal plates of her armored bodysuit. The electricity arcs through the mithril strands weaved throughout her armor and zaps her, making her jump back in pain.
- Arche, bouncing on the tips of her feet, drops her sword from her right hand and balls it into a fist. Running forward, she gathers white moonlight into her fist and slams it into Zel'eon's face. Zel'eon feels his whole body get lifted off the ground by the punch and flies back, landing on the ground, drifting in and out of unconsciousness.
- Arche stands there shocked for a little bit before she rushes over and begins healing Zel'eon back to consciousness, saying, "Oh my god, I'm so sorry, what the fuck," as Saziver crows from the sidelines, "That was sick as fuck!"
- The group heads to the infirmary to heal up, using the machines to heal their wounds from the fight. They make use of one of the machines, an EchoTech MediPod, a magitech device that can diagnose and heal injuries extremely fast.
- Arche apologises profusely to Zel'eon, as Senzorin says, "Don't be sorry, he did this to me last week."
- Zel'eon, looking out the window at the janitor cleaning the field of the remnants of their sparring match, thinks through the battle, trying to figure out where he went wrong. He realises some enemies (like Arche) will have way too high physical defences and that he will need some method of bypassing that by diversifying his combat skillset.
- Senzorin gets a call from Jonathan, asking if he will join them at this point. Senzorin decides he will go with them, while the rest of the group heads home.
