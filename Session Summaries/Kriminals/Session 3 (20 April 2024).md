- After stealing the car from Senzorin's apartment complex garage, the four of them head off towards the causeway between Mosskach and Ilrinia
- Arche suddenly passes out, seeing a full moon in a dark night sky all around her. An androgynous figure appears out of the moon and comes towards her, greeting Arche by her birth name Luvia. The figure reveals herself as the moon goddess Ruatis, and tells Arche that she is the first worshipper of Ruatis in many years. Ruatis tasks Arche with spreading word of Ruatis.
- Arche snaps awake and tells the rest she met God.
- Saziver realises EchoTech can probably track them by their enchanted orichalcum chips in their phones and electronic devices. Everyone upon hearing this, immediately throws their phones away. Saziver however, doesn't want to lose his cyberdeck, his only means of surveillance and his primary mode of communication.
	- Saziver disassembles it and keeps the non orichalcum components, passing the EchoTech manufactured parts to Senzorin.
- Senzorin speeds off and tosses the orichalcum parts into a nearby car, whose window is open because the fat dwarf driver within is smoking out the window. The dwarf, in rage, pulls a gun and fires on Senzorin.
- Arche acts quickly and pulls out one of her collapsible spears of elven make and throws it at the dwarf's car's back left wheel. It punctures the tyre and the car skids off the road. The party speeds off and continues towards the causeway. (50xp)

- The party encounters some trouble at the customs after an EchoTech operative notices Zel'eon's prosthetic arm matching the description of the EchoTech fugitives, but they evade detection and speed off towards Ilrinia. (50xp)
- After arriving in Ilrinia, they refuel their vehicles at a gas station, though noticing that Ilrinia gas stations are a little bit odd. The fuel pumps are manned by automatons, constructs of steel that are animated by magic.
	- They take a break, realising how tired they are from being up all night and fighting just a few hours ago, and decide to find a place to stay. Senzorin decides to bring them to his childhoof home, a skyscraper in the city centre.
- They drive to the central district of Ilrinia, a place filled with skyscrapers and corporations named the Core. However, upon arriving at the skyscraper where the Talos family penthouse is meant to be, the doorman turns them away and tells them nobody by the name of Talos is in te building, and couldn't let anyone random in even if there was.
# 0300hrs, 1st of Mistfall 1892, Ruatis
- The group, in absence of any other plans, decide to head to Arbalest Academy to try and find some place to stay. Senzorin drives them one by one on his motorcycle as the car they took broke down right outside the Talos address. As they arrive outside the school, they all pass out on the grass right outside the front gates.
	- Arche, having to sleep less than the rest, notices a lanky figure sneak into the school and mess with their metal detector, before slinking off into the night.
- The four of them wake up to the principal of the school, John de Bolbec, greeting them. He tells them to head inside with him, and that they can settle accomodations for them.
