# 1000hrs, 1st of Mistfall, Ruatis
Principal John de Bolbec, a tall, lithe middle aged man with blood red eyes, is the first thing Zel'eon, Saziver, Senzorin, and Arche see as they wake up on the front lawn of Arbalest Academy. Still bleary eyed and sleep deprived, they gather the meagre possessions they brought to Ilrinia and follow the principal into the school. 

Senzorin runs into his first Ilrinian obstacle when he is told weapons are not allowed to be on school property and he has to submit his cutlass and revolvers to the security guard before he is allowed in. The rest of the group first try to convince him to give them up, but when they are unsuccessful in the face of Senzorin's paranoia, manage to convince the principal to let him bring in his weapons just for today.

In the principal's office, the four are immediately confronted by Principal John who has seen through their ruse, stating that there is no way exchange students would be permitted to join the Academy so late in their final year. However, he realises they are still exhausted from their escape from Mosskach, and let them go to their housing to rest for the day. The four are suitably chastened and promise to return the next day with a full retelling of their stories.

Later, at their student housing (a two story house just behind Arbalest Park), the group has a discussion about what they should tell the principal. They realise the consequences could be dire, namely EchoTech finding out they are in Ilrinia and hunting them down, and so decide to tell the principal everything. They are about to turn in for the night when they hear a commotion in the direction of the school.

Despite their aching bodies, they run towards the noise, through Arbalest Park. The noise they heard, seemingly of a fight, has quietened down, though they still hear raised voices coming from the pond. They stop short under the cover of the treeline just before the pond as they realise the source of the voices - a squadron of Ilrinian policemen that seem to have just arrived at the scene. The pond in the middle of the park is filled with green and red blood floating up from the depths, and its source is revealed when
