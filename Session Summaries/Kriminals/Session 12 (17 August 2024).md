# TL;DR
- The session begins on the night of the 12th of Lunaris 1892 in Ilrinia. After foiling an assassination attempt on Governor Ortlinde, the team discusses the situation over dinner, Arche and Zel'eon confessing that they were the ones that killed the Storm Serpent, the patron beast that the wood elves were avenging.
- A crowd of reporters knocks at their door, attempting to take pictures and ask questions, but they are interrupted by a large wood elf with panther-like features arriving and calling for Zel'eon and Arche as he claims he knows they slew Lintarath Ten'ar (Storm Serpent). The panther tries to capture Zel'eon and Arche, but they just barely fend him off, getting to their garage.
- Dalen arrives, firing a tank shell at the panther, allowing the team to flee in their vehicles as they notice the fight is destroying the house and so try to go around the back to collect their possessions, hearing the fight in front. They engage in a skirmish with some wood elves hiding behind their house.
- The team stay overnight in Arbalest Academy, visited by Principal John de Bolbec who sympathizes and allows them to stay the night, and an exhausted Dalen, who informs them that the panther has disappeared and to get out of Ilrinia for their safety and those around them.
- On Yros, 13th of Lunaris 1892, they take a bus north to Brunswick. Upon arrival, they stop at a seafood restaurant owned by a middle-aged sea elf who promises them ferry transport to Mosskach after taking money from them. The session ends as they head to the ferry terminal.
