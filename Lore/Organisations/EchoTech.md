Orichalcum, once commonly known as pig iron, is a metal found all over the plains of Ibuth. It was once used only to make weapons and armor for the orc tribes residing in said plains, until it was discovered to have perfect conductivity for both arcane and electrical energy. EchoTech quickly took control of all orichalcum mines, funding an orc warlord who conquered the region, and now controls all mining and manufacture of orichalcum in Aenyrathia.
