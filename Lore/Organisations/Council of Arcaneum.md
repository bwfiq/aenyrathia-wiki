The Council governs mages in Ilrinia and the Deshen Empire, requiring each spellcaster to register under them or be forced to take a magic numbing drug. Their ranks contain magisters, who oversee infrastructural enchantments and wards, executors, who investigate magical phenomena and artifacts, and artificers, who construct automatons to automate menial labour and enchant everyday objects with helpful enchantments.

The members of the Council usually wear dark blue robes with gold accents, with the exception of their executors, who usually dress more eclectically.

The Council is led by 8 Archmages, who each govern a different school of magic and their practitioners in the region. These Archmages are:
- 1st Archmage: [[Elias Thorne]]. Human, 67, Abjuration
- 2nd Archmage: [[Sylaris Vaelith]], Sun Elf, 302, Conjuration
- 3rd Archmage: [[Emeline Valeria]], Human, 54, Divination
- 4th Archmage: [[Albrecht Derven]], Dwarf, 215, Enchantment
- 5th Archmage: [[Nadia Lorenthi]], Human, 39, Evocation
- 6th Archmage: [[Ravion Zethis]], Gnome, 147, Illusion
- 7th Archmage: [[Veylan Duskwhisper]], Sun Elf, 347, Necromancy
- 8th Archmage: [[Cartha Jendri]], Human, 171, Transmutation

Additionally, the Council delegates governance of Ilrinia to [[Anderson Ortlinde]], who handles the day-to-day operations of the city-state.
