# Overview
The Peakers are one of the most notorious gangs in the poorer areas of [[Mosskach|Lore/Locations/Aenyrathia/Ibuth/Mosskach]], characterised by their refusal to stick to the common code of honour among thieves. They make their living by preying by the poor and downtrodden of Mosskach, holding many protection rackets. They are led by Ray Shelby, a portly gangster coming from old money.
# Appearance
Every Peaker wears a leather jacket and a flat cap. The age range of the members of the gang varies greatly, but they are mostly human in species, with the odd half-elf.
