# Neel Serin
Neel Serin is a large city and the cultural and technological capital of the Cyrran people. It is located in the northeastern sea of Aenyrathia, just north of Desh. The Cyrrans, who can't use orichalcum fueled magitech due to the electricity, have developed chemtech, a technology that uses alchemical reactions to power their machines. Neel Serin is the center of this technology, and the city is filled with factories and laboratories that produce all sorts of goods. 

The Cyrrans are one of the only cultures in Aenyrathia that still worship some sort of deity, being Cyr, the old god of the sea and the storm. The Cyrrans, bolstered by their chemtech advancements, have only been widely known for the past 200 years, preferring to stay hidden in the ocean. They were viewed as a superior culture technologically, but this has declined with the advent of orichalcum enabled magitech. Over the last few decades, they have stopped being so protective of their chemtech in an attempt to bolster their research efforts with the help of the rest of Aenyrathia.
