# Overview

The Rah'Zuhari are commonly known as wood elves and live in small tribes all around the ancient forest of Alwahd, northeast of Ilrinia.

Each Rah'Zuhari tribe has a patron beast, a magical creature that they worship and live amongst, and in return, the people of that tribe gain magic and take on physical characteristics reminiscent of their patron beast.

# Tribes

## Whiteape

The Whiteape tribe worships a large albino gorilla, and take on the characteristics of simians; they are broad and bulky, with thick patches of white fur all over their body.

They are led by Mazhuan of the Ivory Hand, a renowned warrior among the Rah'Zuhari. Mazhuan liases with the city of Ilrinia to allow anthropologists who wish to stay with the different tribes of Alwahd.

## Duskmane

The Duskmane tribe is known for its orators and strategists. Their people possess iridescent fur running along their shoulders and backs, along with slitted, feline eyes. They are known for their calulating nature and their ability to anticipate events before they occur.

They worship a patron beast they call the Phantom Lion, which no one, including the Duskmane tribe, has ever seen. Legends say it guides the souls of the Rah'Zuhari to the afterlife.

They are led by the elder Serya Moonfang, who acts as the spiritual leader of Alwahd. She settles disputes all over the forest through her unparalleled wisdom, quashing wars before they begin.

## Stormtalon

The Stormtalon tribe is one of the largest tribes in Alwahd, partly because of their willingness to cross-breed with Ilrinians. They have historically been the largest subset of wood elves within Ilrinia, and have integrated themselves into the city since it started. They bear feathers over their brows and appendages, and some generate static electricity as they walk.

They are led by Karyn Skypierce, the tribe's elder, who oversees Rah'Zuhari participation in Ilrinia, negotiating trade between the two populations and the rest of Aenyrathia.

The Stormtalon tribe live in the closest thing the forest of Alwahd has to a city, calling it Vey Nivalis. Their patron beast, a large jet-black roc, often circles the buildings and strikes lightning at many of them, which is harvested for electricity by the Stormtalons through lightning rods.

## Emberfang

The Emberfang tribe is feared across Alwahd for their mastery of elemental fire. Their patron beast is the closest thing anyone has seen to an actual dragon of myth, snaking across the forest and leaving embers and ash in its wake. They bear fiery patterns of scales across their bodies, and even the youngest Emberfang is able to control fire.

The Emberfang tribe is also highly respected in the forest for being the ones to quell the frequent wildfires in Alwahd. If not for their mastery, the forest would have burned down a long time ago.

They are led by the elder Kiryath Firetongue, who oversees the training of wood elf mages across Alwahd. She is widely known as a collector and preserver of ancient arcane knowledge, and the Council researchers from the Miskatonic University often seek her out for counsel.
