# Overview
Ilrinia, an independent city-state located on the western tip of Desh, the eastern continent, lies across a narrow strait from Mosskach. Founded by the Council of Arcaneum, Ilrinia is governed entirely by the Council, resulting in a system where mage guild leaders wield significant political and economic power. The Forest of Alwahd lies to the east of Ilrinia, adding a lush natural border to the city.

The city is primarily populated by humans, who dominate the traditional spellcasting profession in Aenyrathia. Ilrinia is also home to a significant number of wood elves from Alwahd, though these elves are often looked down upon by their tribal counterparts for becoming too assimilated. Half-elves are more common in Ilrinia than in other cities due to the high esteem sun elves hold for powerful human mages. 

Dwarves are less common in Ilrinia, as automatons have largely replaced manual labour, a shift that has not been favourable to dwarf workers. On the other hand, gnomes have found great opportunity in the city's booming automaton export industry, thriving as engineers and technicians. The last decade has also seen a small but noticeable increase in the orc population, spilling over from the larger wave of orc migration into Mosskach.
# Districts
## Arbalest
Arbalest is a suburban neighbourhood in the southeast of Ilrinia. It is known for its peaceful residential areas, family-friendly parks, and reputable schools, including the prestigious Arbalest Academy where many aspiring mages receive their education. The district also hosts several quiet cafes and small shops, catering to the local community's daily needs.
## The Old City
The Old City, a seaside district, is the historical heart of Ilrinia. It features cobblestone streets, ancient buildings, and remnants of the city's original fortifications. The district is a popular tourist destination, with markets selling traditional crafts and coastal eateries offering fresh seafood. The Old City is also home to several museums and cultural institutions that preserve and celebrate Ilrinia's rich history.
## Greenwich
Greenwich, located in the south, is Ilrinia's merchant district. It is a bustling area filled with markets, shops, and warehouses. However, beneath its commercial exterior, Greenwich is known for its seedy dealings and underground activities. Many businesses here operate under the radar, and bribery and corruption are common as corporations and traders vie for influence over the mage guild leaders.
## Ham Row
Ham Row, in the north, is a mostly abandoned district that serves as Ilrinia's closest equivalent to a slum. Once a thriving industrial area, it has fallen into disrepair as the rise of automatons led to the closure of many factories and workshops. The district now features crumbling buildings and deserted streets, though it still houses some of the city's poorest residents who have no place else to go.
## The Core
The Core is the central district of Ilrinia, home to the headquarters of the Council of Arcaneum and most of the city's major corporations. This area is the political and economic hub of Ilrinia, featuring towering skyscrapers, grandiose council buildings, and luxurious corporate offices. The Core is characterized by its bustling activity, with constant meetings, negotiations, and power plays occurring behind closed doors.
