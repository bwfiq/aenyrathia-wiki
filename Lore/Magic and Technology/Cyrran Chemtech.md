# Overview
This form of magitech dominated Aenyrathia for centuries, developed by the once reculsive Cyrran people. Instead of the orichalcum enabled magitech that is so common in the modern era, it makes use of alchemical reactions to power their machines. Chemtech is still very prevalent in the Cyrran culture since their underwater cities are unable to use orichalcum enabled magitech, and in parts of the world where orichalcum or EchoTech's operation are scarce.

Chemtech mainly uses fluids and reagents drawn from magical creatures in the oceans of Aenyrathia called [[TODO: Magical Ocean Creatures]]. These reagents are exported to other cities at a high price due to them not having access to these creatures. 

TODO: Chemtech being used as mental control (tie in to CC dawgs)
