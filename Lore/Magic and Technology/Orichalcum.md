# Overview
Orichalcum is a metal that is the only known perfect conductor of both electricity and magic. It was previously only known as pig iron, mined by the [[Orcs|Lore/Species/Orcs]] tribes of [[Lore/Locations/Aenyrathia/Ibuth|Lore/Locations/Ibuth]] in small quantities and used in their forges for millennia.. In the year 1843, the properties of pig iron was discovered by [[EchoTech|Lore/Organisations/EchoTech]], leading to the company quickly monopolising the orichalcum production on Ibuth. This control has led to EchoTech becoming the primary manufacturer of magitech products in Aenyrathia.
