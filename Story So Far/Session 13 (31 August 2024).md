# TL;DR
- The team, in the coastal town of Brunswick near Ilrinia, meet the smuggler and board his ferry that is supposed to head to Mosskach.
- The ferry instead brings them to a small cove south of Mosskach. The smuggler, along with a whole group of other smugglers, try to rob the team since they should be weakened after the events of the previous day.
- The team crack their knuckles and get to work slaughtering the smugglers to a man.
- They loot the cove and find some useful loot.
- They work on trying to drive one of the boats, a small dinghy, and succeed in sailing it out of the cove and north up the coast into a small inlet that leads inland up a river.
- They end up at Gnarg, a small mining colony, where Dregdul is waiting for them with a jeep.
- The team and Dregdul drive to Mosskach.
