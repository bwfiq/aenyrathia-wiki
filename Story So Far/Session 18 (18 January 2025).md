# Assault on Winter
- Zel'eon sees peakers massing on the dance floor and casts fireball to take out a load of them, leaving two brutes.
	- Zel is shocked at his ability to do this, as he fired instinctually and didn't install any capability for it.
- Arche tells Senzorin to shoot her, and as he does so, crystals emerge from her back and coalesce into jagged angel wings
- Arche carries Senzorin up to the window they broke out from and enter back into the nightclub.
- A brief melee ensues as Krimewatch takes down the remaining two Peaker brutes in the nightclub along with two EchoTech agents that fought using the partygoers running away as cover.
- Zel'eon discovers Ray Shelby disappeared into a trapdoor down into the Peakers HQ in an underground complex under Winter.
- They descend into the trapdoor after Zel'eon controls it with his systems, and are quickly hit by noxious gas that addles Zel'eon's and Senzorin's minds.
# The Hallway
- Senzorin is hit with a vision in Einrow's high rise apartment while Zel'eon is in his bed with his mother reading him medical journals
- They snap out of it and begin finding a way out.
- Krimewatch works together to heat and cut through the steel bar on the door blocking their way out into...
# The Supply Room
- A peaker supply room where two brutes immediately attack, throwing a knife at Zel'eon.
	- During the fight, Zel discovers his ability to see the trajectory of incoming and outgoing attacks.
- As they begin to investigate the supply room, Zel'eon investigates how he could do the things he didn't install systems for. He realises the chip has begun expanding into his brain an organic computer that evolves systems for him based on need.
- He diverts higher functions in his brain towards a directive to simply search for all the orichalcum in his room with the objective in forcing an adaptation to happen. The rest watch as blood tendrils reach out from his fingers and find all the orichalcum in the room (1kg).
	- Arche and Senzorin ask what is going on but Zel doesnt give a full explanation.
- They also find 2 Dusk Blasters, 20 pistols, and 10 enchanted steel pipes, along with 5 pipes of Aggro, a combat enhancing drug.
- Senzorin finds a secret door that leads into a laboratory.
# The Laboratory
- They see a pod containing nutrient sludge and a prototype of a synth child, which they later destroy.
- They also find a bunch of cybernetically enhanced magical creatures whose mana is being harvested, all of which they free.
- They find a unicorn with a mane of fire, that they later find is called an Ignifera.
	- They devise a plan to feed it back the mana that was absorbed from it, and revitalise it.
	- The Ignifera seems to take a liking to Senzorin.
# The Security Room
- Senzorin picks the lock to a security room adjacent to the supply room and hacks the security console, downloading all the security footage onto his device before looking through the facility and finding that Ray Shelby was being installed into a mech suit in his lair by one of his lackeys, along with Laura being held captive there. 
- Zel'eon grabs hold of some mains power lines and overloads the building's grid, shutting off power.
- Krimewatch rushes down a small hallway, emerging into Ray Shelby's lair.
# Ray Shelby Boss Fight
- Ray Shelby, the leader of the Peakers, has installed himself in a mech suit and lumbers over to Krimewatch, taunting them.
- A battle occurs, with them defeating Ray Shelby and freeing Laura.
- They loot his office and find 2x Vortex Blades, 6 gold bars, and a one-time use EchoTech access key.
- They ascend the staircase out, letting the creatures free, and escape, Zel'eon and Arche flying on their wings while Senzorin and Laura ride off on the Ignifera.
# Dismantling the Peakers
- Over the coming week, Krimewatch dismantles the now leaderless Peaker operation with the intel from Ray Shelby. 
- Zel'eon works on a shock collar, bedazzling it, and sends out deactivated remotes for the collar to all the shopkeepers in Sector 7 who were giving the Peakers protection money.
- Senzorin learns the Ignifera's species name after doing some research at a library he used to go to as a child.
	- He talks through it with Zel'eon as a conduit and asks its' name, being Miranai, and offers to build it a new body.
- Arche, with Zel'eon's help, implements the rune of protection from the cyborg into her mithril bodysuit, making it +1.
- Zel'eon builds Miranai a new body by modifying Senzorin's chopper, turning it into a motorcycle with a large horse skull on its front handle bars.
# Addressing Rukh Zidul
- Zel'eon addresses the shopkeepers he assembled, telling them the Peakers are dismantled and that they can torture Ray Shelby as much as they want with the shock collar.
- He tells them EchoTech's control on them is over and to never listen to an Etsy ever again.
- Krimewatch arranges themselves in a formation over Ray Shelby's bound body, with Zel'eon spreading his mechanical wings and Arche spreading her angel wings in a sphere of twilight, and Senzorin in the centre on Miranai in bike form, shooting fire across the sky.
- Just then, Arche gets a text from Dalen Blackwell with a terse message: "Need you back here NOW."
