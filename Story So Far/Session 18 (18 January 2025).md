As the partygoers stream out of Winter, various Peaker mooks push through the crowd, attempting to mass on the dance floor. Zel'eon, still perched on the second floor railing, instinctively holds out his arm. As his launcher grows bright and red hot, his wings spread out, venting the heat from his body as a large bolt of elemental fire coalesces at the tip of his cannon. Before the Peakers are able to move out of the way, a huge ball of fire impacts the crowd of them, immolating most and severely harming the rest. Zel'eon stands there, shocked at this new ability, but notices a bright light coming from behind him.

As this was happening, Arche, from her position on the street after having jumped out the window seconds prior, sees Zel'eon fire off this fireball. She turns to Senzorin and tells him to shoot her with his pistol. Senzorin is understandably confused, but raises the revolver given to him by Einrow, firing it at Arche's back. As the bullet impacts, clear crystal shards shoot out, forming into large jagged angel wings. Arche grabs Senzorin and takes off, flying back into Winter, depositing herself and Senzorin next to Zel'eon.

Zel'eon makes a beeline to the back of the club, but discovers Ray Shelby has disappeared. Senzorin drops down from the second floor, engaging one of the Peaker brutes and taking him out. As the other remaining Peaker closes the gap between him and Senzorin, Arche flies down directly onto him, spearing him through the chest as a sphere of dim light surrounds her.

Just then, a shot rings out from the crowd of partygoers trying to make their exit from the club. Senzorin ducks, seeing two EchoTech agents in the crowd. The agents toss concussive grenades at Krimewatch, uncaring about the safety of the crowd. Zel'eon flies over from the DJ console and takes down one of the EchoTech agents, while the other disappears out the exit with the rest of the crowd. 

As the dust settles from the brief melee, they discover that Ray Shelby disappeared through a platform at the DJ console. Zel'eon lets his blood drip through the gaps in the platform, accessing its mechanical controls and lowering him and the rest down into a hallway filled with noxious gas.

As Arche shields herself from the gas using her mask, she sees Senzorin and Zel'eon staring blankly ahead, their eyes glassy. Senzorin sees a vision of himself in Einrow's apartment while Zel'eon is back in the clinic, tucked into bed while his mother reads him medical case studies. They both enjoy their visions, but know that they are under the effects of the gas, and slap themselves out of it. Back in reality, Arche tries to stop the flow of gas from a grate in the floor by placing her suit jacket over it and wetting it, but it does not help. Senzorin and Zel'eon both try freezing the grate with their ice spells, but are unable to muster the creativity needed to modify their usual combat spells into a spell of freezing. 

They manage to resist the effects of the gas, and make their way to the end of the hallway, where they see a barred steel sliding door. Zel'eon unsheathes his arm blade, and begins sawing through the bar while Arche and Senzorin heat it up to speed up the process as much as they can. After a few arduous minutes of them trying to resist the gas, Zel'eon breaks through the bar and slides the door open, and ducks just in time to avoid a knife thrown from the next room.

As Zel'eon barges in, he sees a Peaker supply room with two brutes inside, one with a brace of daggers attached to his hand and the other with two large magitech power gauntlets. 
# Assault on Winter
- Zel'eon sees peakers massing on the dance floor and casts fireball to take out a load of them, leaving two brutes.
	- Zel is shocked at his ability to do this, as he fired instinctually and didn't install any capability for it.
- Arche tells Senzorin to shoot her, and as he does so, crystals emerge from her back and coalesce into jagged angel wings
- Arche carries Senzorin up to the window they broke out from and enter back into the nightclub.
- A brief melee ensues as Krimewatch takes down the remaining two Peaker brutes in the nightclub along with two EchoTech agents that fought using the partygoers running away as cover.
- Zel'eon discovers Ray Shelby disappeared into a trapdoor down into the Peakers HQ in an underground complex under Winter.
- They descend into the trapdoor after Zel'eon controls it with his systems, and are quickly hit by noxious gas that addles Zel'eon's and Senzorin's minds.
# The Hallway
- Senzorin is hit with a vision in Einrow's high rise apartment while Zel'eon is in his bed with his mother reading him medical journals
- They snap out of it and begin finding a way out.
- Krimewatch works together to heat and cut through the steel bar on the door blocking their way out into...
# The Supply Room
- A peaker supply room where two brutes immediately attack, throwing a knife at Zel'eon.
	- During the fight, Zel discovers his ability to see the trajectory of incoming and outgoing attacks.
- As they begin to investigate the supply room, Zel'eon investigates how he could do the things he didn't install systems for. He realises the chip has begun expanding into his brain an organic computer that evolves systems for him based on need.
- He diverts higher functions in his brain towards a directive to simply search for all the orichalcum in his room with the objective in forcing an adaptation to happen. The rest watch as blood tendrils reach out from his fingers and find all the orichalcum in the room (1kg).
	- Arche and Senzorin ask what is going on but Zel doesnt give a full explanation.
- They also find 2 Dusk Blasters, 20 pistols, and 10 enchanted steel pipes, along with 5 pipes of Aggro, a combat enhancing drug.
- Senzorin finds a secret door that leads into a laboratory.
# The Laboratory
- They see a pod containing nutrient sludge and a prototype of a synth child, which they later destroy.
- They also find a bunch of cybernetically enhanced magical creatures whose mana is being harvested, all of which they free.
- They find a unicorn with a mane of fire, that they later find is called an Ignifera.
	- They devise a plan to feed it back the mana that was absorbed from it, and revitalise it.
	- The Ignifera seems to take a liking to Senzorin.
# The Security Room
- Senzorin picks the lock to a security room adjacent to the supply room and hacks the security console, downloading all the security footage onto his device before looking through the facility and finding that Ray Shelby was being installed into a mech suit in his lair by one of his lackeys, along with Laura being held captive there. 
- Zel'eon grabs hold of some mains power lines and overloads the building's grid, shutting off power.
- Krimewatch rushes down a small hallway, emerging into Ray Shelby's lair.
# Ray Shelby Boss Fight
- Ray Shelby, the leader of the Peakers, has installed himself in a mech suit and lumbers over to Krimewatch, taunting them.
- A battle occurs, with them defeating Ray Shelby and freeing Laura.
- They loot his office and find 2x Vortex Blades, 6 gold bars, and a one-time use EchoTech access key.
- They ascend the staircase out, letting the creatures free, and escape, Zel'eon and Arche flying on their wings while Senzorin and Laura ride off on the Ignifera.
# Dismantling the Peakers
- Over the coming week, Krimewatch dismantles the now leaderless Peaker operation with the intel from Ray Shelby. 
- Zel'eon works on a shock collar, bedazzling it, and sends out deactivated remotes for the collar to all the shopkeepers in Sector 7 who were giving the Peakers protection money.
- Senzorin learns the Ignifera's species name after doing some research at a library he used to go to as a child.
	- He talks through it with Zel'eon as a conduit and asks its' name, being Miranai, and offers to build it a new body.
- Arche, with Zel'eon's help, implements the rune of protection from the cyborg into her mithril bodysuit, making it +1.
- Zel'eon builds Miranai a new body by modifying Senzorin's chopper, turning it into a motorcycle with a large horse skull on its front handle bars.
# Addressing Rukh Zidul
- Zel'eon addresses the shopkeepers he assembled, telling them the Peakers are dismantled and that they can torture Ray Shelby as much as they want with the shock collar.
- He tells them EchoTech's control on them is over and to never listen to an Etsy ever again.
- Krimewatch arranges themselves in a formation over Ray Shelby's bound body, with Zel'eon spreading his mechanical wings and Arche spreading her angel wings in a sphere of twilight, and Senzorin in the centre on Miranai in bike form, shooting fire across the sky.
- Just then, Arche gets a text from Dalen Blackwell with a terse message: "Need you back here NOW."
