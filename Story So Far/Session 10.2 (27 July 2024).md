# Recap
## The Press Conference
The soft light of the Zalaris morning filtered through the curtains of Zel’eon and Senzorin’s living room as they lounged on their couch. It's the 25th of Mistfall 1892, the day after Zel'eon and Arche had finished their ritual to Ruatis on the rooftop of the Peak. They watched as a televised press conference delivered by the Council of Arcaneum's Archmage of Divination, Emeline Valeria, announced the findings of the Council regarding the culprits of the golem attack on the Horizon Community Centre on the 22nd of Mistfall. Her voice, crisp and commanding, filled the room as she condemned Thibault Carroway, the leader of the Purists, for his supposed role in the recent golem attack on the Horizon Community Centre. Behind her, Lyra Valen, the leader of the New Dawn, wore a satisfied expression, her pleasure evident as the narrative unfolded.

The two young men exchanged glances. They, along with Saziver, Arche, and Ellipses, had discovered the Purists' incompetence in their machinations, and had surmised they probably weren't the ones behind the golem attack. They had then delivered Carroway to Lyra along with the evidence of this fact. However, a sudden knock at the door interrupted their thoughts.

Zel'eon opened it to find a gift hamper from the Council, brimming with treasures: jars of rare honey, a wheel of dwarven cheese, glimmer berries, and dire boar ham. Accompanying the hamper were two letters—one from Dalen Blackwell, representing the Council, and another from Lyra Valen herself. Dalen's letter expressed congratulations for their brave actions during the golem attack and detailed a reward of 3,000 Ilrinian dollars to be credited to each member of the party. Lyra's letter echoed similar sentiments, thanking them profusely for their assistance in identifying the true culprit behind the chaos at the community centre, along with a reward of 2,000 Ilrinian dollars each.

As they discussed the implications of the Council's intrigue and the New Dawn’s involvement with the Purists, Zel’eon and Senzorin decided to remain detached from the unfolding drama. They agreed that if their help was truly needed, either Dalen and Lyra would reach out to them. With their breakfast finished, they prepared to head to Arbalest Academy, eager for the excitement of combat class. Zel’eon, energized by the prospect of sparring, managed to persuade Senzorin to engage in a one-on-one match for the first time.
## Combat Class
The clash of steel against armour echoed across the training field behind Arbalest Academy as the weekly combat class commenced. Students squared off in intense sparring matches, their teachers trading formal attire for combat-ready gear. Zel’eon, clad in shining white armour that gleamed in the sunlight, stood confidently with his wings unfurled, while Senzorin faced him, feeling unprepared in comparison. He gripped his cutlass in one hand, the other empty, as he fended off a relentless barrage of attacks.

After a few moments, their instructor, Mr. Thorne, called for a pause. He pulled Senzorin aside and urged him to adopt his usual combat stance, suggesting that fighting without his revolver wasn’t natural. Senzorin fired back that he wasn't allowed to carry ammunition into the school, but the manticore told him to try it anyway. As Senzorin settled into his familiar stance, shouldering his cutlass and staying light on his feet, Zel’eon seized the opportunity to strike, lunging forward with fierce determination, relishing the thrill of combat.

Senzorin evaded for a time, but growing weary and in a moment of desperation, instinctively pointed his unloaded revolver at Zel’eon and pulled the trigger. To their astonishment, a bolt of elemental fire shot forth, catching Zel’eon in the chest and sending him stumbling back. Mr. Thorne roared with delight, urging Zel’eon to fight back. Zel’eon regrouped, defending against the barrage of fire that Senzorin unleashed, but soon found himself overwhelmed.

Disoriented and scrambling to regain his focus, Zel’eon slammed his palms onto the ground, unleashing a wave of ice that enveloped Senzorin and sent him crashing to the ground, unconscious. After the match, and with Mr. Thorne’s congratulations still ringing in his ears, Zel’eon carried his friend to the infirmary. As Senzorin regained consciousness, he initially berated Zel’eon for not revealing his magical ability, but then recalled his own feat. Their faces broke into grins as they contemplated the potential of their newfound powers and how to develop them further.
## Senzorin and Jonathan's First Date
Returning home on the afternoon of the 25th of Mistfall, Zel'eon and Senzorin decide to pursue further their plans of getting parts for their broken down vintage sedan, a Talos Sovereign. Senzorin prepared for a date with Jonathan Ralston, a student from Miskatonic University who they had saved during the golem attack, and who Senzorin had been texting over the last few days. Not particularly being interested in the spoiled rich kid, Senzorin's main objective was to glean information about Jonathan’s father, Victor Ralston, who owned a Talos Sovereign similar to the one they wanted to repair. Zel’eon decided to shadow them from the rooftops, eavesdropping on their conversation through an audio channel broadcast from Senzorin’s phone.

The evening air was crisp as Senzorin arrived at the designated meeting spot. Jonathan greeted him warmly, a flirty smile playing on his lips. As their conversation continued through the late afternoon, Zel’eon crouched atop the rooftops, ears tuned into the unfolding date. Through the audio feed, he learned vital information about the exclusive Chrome Lounge, accessible only through a private elevator in one of the Platinum Tower’s sub-basements. Jonathan revealed that his father planned to showcase his Talos Sovereign in just a few days, and the car would be sent to the garage at 3 PM. This new knowledge intrigued the pair, even as Senzorin found himself oddly enjoying the date more than he would have thought he would.
## The Albino Man
After the date concluded, Senzorin and Zel’eon understood they required more details to execute their plan effectively. As the afternoon sun sank below the horizon, casting long shadows over the bustling streets of Ilrinia, the pair made their way to the Iron Horse Tavern, a well-known bar in the Greenwich district that Senzorin knew had ties to the Thieves' Guild.

Upon arriving, Senzorin hesitated outside the tavern, his gaze drifting across the street to a small bubble tea shop. There, he spotted the half-elf woman he had previously tried to charm, only to be rebuffed. Summoning his courage, he decided to give it another shot. This time, fortune smiled upon him; he received a smile and a name - Emily. Bolstered by this small victory, he rejoined Zel’eon at the tavern. They sat at the bar and awaited their chance to speak with someone who could provide the crucial information they needed.

Soon, a portly man emerged from the backroom, his expression sour as he shot Senzorin a pointed glare. Recognizing him as a fence from their previous dealings, Senzorin approached him, inquiring about information regarding the Platinum Tower. The man’s response was curt, his demeanor as unwelcoming as ever, but he directed them to the backroom.

With a nod from Sam, the duo descended a narrow staircase, entering a hidden bar that mirrored the Iron Horse Tavern above. This secretive space was dimly lit and sparsely populated, an unseen force cleaning glasses behind the bar, while a middle-aged albino man sat alone in the middle of the room, observing them with a piercing intensity.

The albino man's gaze seemed to weigh heavily on them as he spoke, requesting a favour in exchange for the information they sought. He revealed that an EchoTech prototype was being held by a gang known as the Avjarn, located in the derelict district of Ham Row. The man provided little else in the way of details, only mentioning that the Avjarn could be identified by their distinctive heavy armour.

Senzorin and Zel’eon stepped out of the tavern, prepared to face whoever - or whatever - this Avjarn was.
## The Avjarn
Senzorin and Zel’eon made their way through the dimly lit streets of Ham Row, where the shadows of abandoned buildings loomed over them. The air carried a chill, thick with the scent of decay and neglect. As they progressed, Senzorin sent his owl familiar into the night, the small creature gliding effortlessly through the darkness to scout ahead. It didn’t take long for the owl to spot a glint of metal in a nearby alley, drawing the pair closer.

Peering into the alley, they saw a group of heavily armoured figures huddled around a table, their faces concealed behind menacing visors. The sight sent a flicker of caution down Zel’eon’s spine. Stepping forward from the cover of shadows, he moved cautiously, wary of the figures’ reaction.

As he approached, the tension in the air thickened, the armoured figures shifting uneasily. One of them rose, flipping up his visor to reveal a middle-aged orc with a weathered face, his skin a rich brown hue decorated with scars that told stories of battles fought. Senzorin and Zel’eon exchanged surprised glances; orcs like him were rarely seen in Ilrinia, especially ones that had not succumbed to the city’s gentrification.

With an air of tentative diplomacy, they introduced themselves, carefully conveying their intentions to speak with the Avjarn’s leader. The brown-skinned orc, introducing himself as Urag, studied them for a moment before nodding, beckoning them to follow. He led them into an abandoned clothing store that concealed a hidden passage leading down to the Avjarn's hideout.

Descending into the basement, they entered a sprawling communal living space where the walls of the former apartment complex had been torn down. The sight stirred a deep empathy within Senzorin and Zel’eon as they listened to Urag recount the Avjarn’s harrowing past—how they had escaped the tyranny of an orc warlord funded by EchoTech, who had unified the tribes of Ibuth to monopolize the orichalcum supply in the region.

Eventually, they were brought before Xugha, the leader of the Avjarn. He was a formidable figure with pitch-black skin, his presence commanding yet cautious. The room he occupied was filled with masterfully crafted weapons and armour, each piece a testament to the Avjarn’s skills, alongside a nondescript padlocked safe tucked away in the corner.

Xugha regarded them with a mix of suspicion and intrigue. The weight of the moment hung in the air as he listened to their story. Slowly, the tension began to dissipate, and his demeanor shifted from guarded to slightly more open, though the underlying caution remained. After a thoughtful pause, he allowed Senzorin and Zel’eon to stay for the night, instructing them to keep the location of the Avjarn’s hideout a secret to protect them from potential reprisal by EchoTech.

As night deepened, the atmosphere inside the Avjarn's hideout transformed into one of warmth and camaraderie. Senzorin and Zel’eon shared hearty drinks with their new companions, the rich flavours of the Orcish brew warming their spirits and easing the strain of the day.

As they conversed, Zel’eon began to notice a stark difference in the Avjarn’s culture compared to the orcs he grew up with in Mosskach. Unlike his kin, who revelled in combat and sparring, these orcs seemed content to build and create, channelling their energies into craftsmanship rather than conflict.

Once the festivities settled and the orcs succumbed to sleep, Senzorin slipped on his cloak of invisibility. He moved quietly through the hideout, the padlocked safe in Xugha’s quarters looming larger in his mind. Yet, as he scouted the space, the thought of stealing from the Avjarn felt increasingly wrong. Each corner he turned revealed scenes of resilience and community, deepening his empathy for their plight and the life they had carved out amidst adversity.

Eventually, Senzorin and Zel’eon returned home, fatigue pulling at their limbs. Sharing a silence, their night with the Avjarn still fresh in their minds, they found themselves questioning their mission. They resolved to seek a different path—one wouldn't jeopardise the Avjarn.
## Hacking into the Platinum Tower
On the 26th of Mistfall, the sun rose brightly over the city as Senzorin and Zel’eon made their way back to the Avjarn hideout. They descended below the hideout to where the Avjarn had carved out a large cavern, setting up their forges. Zel’eon focused intently on his project, making a ceremonial rapier adorned with the elvish symbol of the moon, a birthday gift for Arche. Meanwhile, Senzorin worked on a striking steel full moon, the size of a disco ball. As they hammered away, the conversation inevitably shifted back to their plans. The idea of hacking into the Platinum Tower’s security systems took root in their minds, presenting an opportunity to achieve their goals without harming the Avjarn.

As dusk approached and they left the Avjarn hideout, Senzorin called Jonathan. Jonathan picked up almost instantly, Jonathan’s voice brightening at the sound of Senzorin's name. With his family out of town, Jonathan extended an invitation to his penthouse in the Platinum Tower, providing a chance for Senzorin to gather information. Before parting ways, Senzorin opened a secure audio channel to Zel’eon’s phone, and they split up—Zel’eon heading home while Senzorin made his way to Jonathan’s.

Upon arriving at the penthouse, Senzorin was welcomed into Jonathan’s room, where they shared a passionate encounter that left Senzorin pleasantly surprised by the depth of his enjoyment, despite knowing he had an ulterior motive involving Jonathan’s father. Meanwhile, Zel’eon sat mortified, his face flushed with embarrassment as he listened through the audio channel. The sounds of their intimacy filled the silence, amplifying his discomfort as he tried to focus on the heist they had planned.

After their passionate moments, Jonathan lay peacefully satisfied in bed, and Senzorin seized the opportunity to excuse himself. Quietly, he slipped away to the kitchen where he had previously seen a computer terminal. He hacked into the security systems, gathering vital information about the private parking garage, and sent the details to Zel’eon. With a sigh of relief, he ended the audio communication, returning to Jonathan’s side. They spent the night together, while Zel’eon, mercifully left to his own thoughts, planned the heist for the following day.
## The Heist
The morning of the 27th of Mistfall dawned bright and clear, sunlight streaming through the windows as Senzorin and Zel’eon shared a simple breakfast. The faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the scent of fried dire boar ham filled the air, but their thoughts were focused on the task ahead. With determination etched on his face, Zel’eon leaned across the table, demonstrating the intricate steps required to remove the engine block from their own Talos Sovereign. They had meticulously planned for Senzorin to handle the heist alone, knowing that his agility and stealth far surpassed Zel’eon’s own.

As the afternoon approached, the clock ticked closer to 3:30 PM. Senzorin and Zel’eon arrived at the towering Platinum Tower, its sleek glass façade glinting in the sunlight. Senzorin donned the cloak of invisibility, rendering him nearly undetectable as he slipped through the unarmed fire exit door.

Senzorin descended several flights, pausing at the bottom at the door to the garage. Pushing the door open slowly, it creaked loudly, sending a jolt of panic through him. He froze, holding his breath as guards on the other side stirred, their keen senses alert to the disturbance. After a tense moment, the guards moved on, and Senzorin seized the opportunity to try the door again. But fortune was not on his side; the door creaked once more, and the guards immediately snapped into a combat stance, their eyes scanning the area. 

Senzorin, realising he had to act quickly, whipped out his revolver and fired at one of the guards, but the close proximity threw off his aim, and the shot went wide, ricocheting off the wall with a sharp crack. Cursing under his breath, Senzorin lunged forward, swiftly knocking out the guard in the stairwell. He burst into the garage just in time to see another guard rushing toward the security console. He took careful aim again, pulling the trigger and knocking the guard out cold before taking stock of the situation.

In the centre of the garage, a large tarp covered a vehicle sitting in the middle of a glowing teleportation circle. Senzorin strode over and yanked the tarp aside, revealing the sleek lines of the Talos Sovereign beneath. Following Zel’eon’s instructions, he swiftly disconnected the engine block, the mechanics of the task almost instinctual as he shoved the precious cargo into his bag of holding. With the engine block secured, Senzorin darted back toward the fire exit, bounding up the steps with a sense of urgency. As he burst into the alleyway, he threw on the cloak of invisibility just in time to evade a surveillance crystal mounted near the door.

Zel’eon was waiting on Senzorin’s motorcycle, engine rumbling softly, a beacon of escape. He felt the rush of air as Senzorin landed on the back, and without hesitation, he revved the engine and sped off. The afternoon sun hung high above Ilrinia, casting a warm glow on the exhilarated duo as they raced home, laughter spilling from their lips, giddy with the thrill of their successful heist.
