# Recap
## Zel'eon, Arche, Senzorin, and Saziver
On the morning of Udis, the 30th of Eternae, 1892, Zel'eon Talos stood outside his clinic in the bustling streets of Mosskach. The sun was just beginning to light up the day as he conversed with Dregdul, a large orc youth. They were deeply entrenched in a discussion about the recent rise in gang troubles when suddenly, the roar of a motorcycle engine broke their focus.

Senzorin, a half-elf rogue, pulled up on his sputtering bike, which whined mechanically before coming to a halt. Zel'eon's gaze quickly flicked to Senzorin’s face, which was marred by a grimace of pain, and to the three clawed gash that marred his side.

Senzorin explained that Arche, his roommate and Zel’eon's employee, had invited him to receive treatment at the clinic. With a knowing nod, Zel'eon gestured for him to enter and led him up the stairs to the surgery room on the second floor. Zel'eon began disinfecting Senzorin's infected wound, meticulously stitching it shut as Senzorin winced in pain. Though he didn't mention it to Senzorin, Zel'eon noted the wound as being from a werewolf. Senzorin’s gaze wandered around the room, lingering on the scratches along the walls, evidence as to Zel'eon's other proclivities.

Just then, Arche entered, her prim demeanor faltering momentarily as she took in Senzorin’s condition. She admonished Senzorin for not taking better care of himself as he wryly bantered with her. 

Zel'eon’s attention shifted as his communicator buzzed—a text message from Maria, his employee at the front desk, informed him of a nervous gnome named Saziver awaiting him. The trio descended to the first floor, where they found Saziver standing at the counter, glancing anxiously around the room. The sight of Senzorin caught him off guard, having previously surveilled the rogue during his escapades.  “I should have known you’d be involved with this lot,” Senzorin quipped as he took his leave, letting Zel'eon and Saziver continue their conversation in private.

Once alone, Saziver leaned in, visibly excited as he told Zel'eon that he had discovered an experimental chip created by EchoTech—an intriguing piece of technology that could potentially link Zel'eon’s implants directly to his mind. Saziver informed him the chip was currently on an EchoTech transport heading toward the city that very night. Zel'eon acknowledged this, his mind already racing with possibilities as he bid Saziver farewell, ready to formulate a plan.
## Ray Shelby and the Peakers
Eager to act on the information Saziver provided, Zel'eon reached out to Ray Shelby, the local gang leader of the Peakers. Sitting at his desk on the third floor of the clinic, he knew he needed Shelby’s crew if they were to pull off a caper. Before long, the unmistakable sounds of Shelby’s approach filled the air, punctuated by the acrid aroma of cheap cologne that trailed behind him. He swaggered into the office, exuding a false confidence that crawled under the young man’s skin.

Zel'eon divulged the details about the EchoTech transport scheduled to pass by that evening, but he could see the flicker of greed ignite in Ray's eyes. A warning bell rang in Zel'eon’s mind, and the realization of his error dawned on his mind. When Ray departed, his anger boiled over, prompting Zel'eon to punch a wall in a fit of irritation, the impact echoing throughout the clinic.

Determined to rectify his miscalculation, he called Senzorin, Arche, and Saziver back to the clinic, hopeful that together they could assist him. Motivated by gratitude for everything Zel'eon had done for the community and their shared animosity toward the Peakers, the trio readily agreed to help.

Reunited at the clinic, Saziver provided a detailed briefing on the transport's route, and they began to weave their strategy around the Peakers’ planned ambush, intending to use it as a distraction to slip in unnoticed and swipe the valuable chip from the back of the transport.

As dusk descended upon Mosskach, Zel'eon, Arche, and Senzorin positioned themselves stealthily atop the clinic’s roof, while Saziver took his perch in the office on the third floor, ready to monitor the approaching transport through a hacked feed.
## Ambushing the EchoTech Transport
With Saziver in their ears steadily counting down the minutes, the clock inched closer to midnight, the moment when the transport was set to pass directly by the clinic and into the waiting clutches of the Peakers. Below, the Peakers lounged along the street, clad in flat caps and leather jackets, scattering caltrops along the pavement, small metal spikes meant to pop the transport’s tires. 

As Zel'eon glanced at Arche, he found her gazing skyward, murmuring quiet prayers to her goddess. He searched for Senzorin, but the rogue had seamlessly melted away into the shadows. Down in the alley next to the clinic, Senzorin tightened his grip on the cutlass once wielded by his mentor, Einrow, ready for the fight ahead.

Saziver, from his vantage point on the second floor, spoke into their headsets with an urgent whisper: the transport was approaching. The distant headlights cut through the dimming dusk, illuminating the street ahead. As the transport rumbled into view, it seemed to hit an unseen obstacle, and in an instant, the tires exploded in a catastrophic pop, sending it careening toward a nearby bus stop.

The Peakers erupted from their hiding spots, their cries loud and triumphant as they rushed forward to seize the chaos. Seizing the opportunity, Arche leaped from her perch and sprinted toward the rear of the transport.

A barrage of explosions erupted as the cabin doors of the transport flew open, two heavily armed guards jumping out to unleash a ferocious hail of fire from their magitech rifles. Arche's advance faltered when a heat grenade detonated nearby, the vibrating force momentarily disorienting her. As she fought to regain her balance, she locked eyes with a lone Peaker who had crept toward the back of the van, clearly having had the same plan as the team. Just as he opened his mouth to call for help, a deafening explosion pierced the air—his kneecap shattered in a spray of blood and flesh.

Spinning to locate the source of the shot, Arche spotted Senzorin, his revolver aimed with uncanny accuracy. He cocked his head, motioning her toward the target.

Arche lunged at the fallen gang member, thrusting her spear through his mouth to silence his scream of pain before darting towards the back of the transport. She darted toward the transport, grappling with the padlock securing the doors, only to discover that it was reinforced both physically and magically.

With concentration, she began to unravel the enchantment just as, unbeknownst to her, one of the EchoTech guards approached from the front. The guard rounded the van just in time to see her. Raising his rifle, he shouted in surprise. Arche reacted quickly, disarming him and sending his weapon clattering to the ground. Enraged, the guard lunged for her, brandishing a security baton, but something above him caught his attention.

Zel'eon’s arm blade sang through the air, severing the guard’s head in a swift, lethal motion. The lifeless body swayed for a heartbeat before collapsing. Without hesitation, Zel'eon aimed his arm at the padlock, firing an acid vial from his weapon. The lock fizzled and dissolved under the corrosive torrent, and Senzorin yanked open the transport's doors, revealing a silver briefcase nestled inside.

Senzorin dove into the opening, grabbing the briefcase, and sprinted into the alleyway, Arche hot on his heels. Before bolting after them, Zel'eon took a moment to etch a message onto the helmet of the decapitated guard, hurling the incriminating object into the van's interior before sealing the doors and fled toward an underground fight pit—a place he knew was safe.

Meanwhile, Saziver remained in Zel'eon’s office, curled into a fetal position within the comforting glow of multiple screens, panic gnawing at his nerves as he heard the chaos erupt nearby. The Peakers, intoxicated by victory, soon overwhelmed the remaining EchoTech guard, their triumphant shouts echoing as they closed in on their prize. Saziver heard only their angry shouts as they found the message Zel'eon left for them on the helmet: "For Ray Shelby."
## Examining the Chip
Hours later, the street in front of Zel’eon's clinic lay silent, save for the smoldering wreckage of the EchoTech transport. The team had gathered back inside the clinic, the exhilaration of their earlier success buzzing in the air. Yet, unease tinged Saziver's words as he voiced his fears about EchoTech potentially tracking the stolen chip.

Zel’eon shared Saziver’s apprehension. He led Saziver to his workshop for a closer inspection of the chip. As they examined it, they discovered that it was entirely crafted from orichalcum—a rare metal renowned for being the only perfect conductor of both electricity and magic - featuring a series of pins on the back, intended to be directly inserted into brain tissue.

Zel’eon noted with relief that there didn’t appear to be any embedded tracking software. Instead, it seemed to be engineered to translate electrical signals through the user’s circulatory system, effectively granting someone the ability to control electronic devices with their mind.

The rest of the team eventually drifted into the workshop, their earlier tension giving way to celebration. Dregdul proposed a traditional Orcish drinking contest to Senzorin. They began trading drinks as Zel’eon glanced up intermittently from his work to watch their antics. Senzorin, fueled by determination, matched Dregdul drink for drink, the air filled with boisterous cheers and playful jabs between the orc and the elf.

Arche moved among her teammates, tending to their wounds and ensuring everyone was taken care of as the evening wore on. Finally, she settled into a chair, observing Senzorin and Dregdul as they grew progressively more inebriated.

At last, Saziver bid the team goodnight, retreating to his home, while the others remained in a celebratory haze. Zel’eon, hungry to tap into the true potential of the chip, began drawing plans for the surgical procedure that would implant it directly into his brain.
## Implanting the Chip into Zel'eon's Brain
As Senzorin and Dregdul lay sprawled on the floor of the workshop after their drinking contest, the faint sounds of snoring punctuated the otherwise quiet room where Zel’eon proposed his plan for the surgical procedure to implant the chip to Arche. They carefully refined the steps required for the surgery and eventually, after hours of discussion and preparation, Arche agreed to perform the surgery on Zel’eon.

Zel’eon strapped himself into the patient’s chair for the first time under a doctor that wasn't himself or his mother. As a wave of apprehension washed over him, Arche carefully made the first incision, skillfully splitting the skin above his frontal lobe.

The moment Arche began to drill a hole in his skull sufficient for the chip to fit through, pain erupted through Zel’eon’s body. It was an all-consuming agony, more than he had ever experienced, and it made him scream, his cries echoing throughout the clinic and into the quiet neighborhood beyond. Arche pressed on with the procedure, her focus unwavering, as the sounds of his suffering rang loud in her ears.

As soon as the drill pierced through the final layer of his skull, Arche deftly dropped the chip through the newly created hole, the pins penetrating into Zel'eon’s frontal lobe like tiny needles and establishing a connection instantly. She quickly covered the opening, meticulously stitching him up.

As Zel’eon’s pain began to fade, he opened his eyes, blinking against the remnants of the pain that had blurred his vision. Shakily, he sat up in the chair, seeing the first rays of the dawn sun shine through the windows of his office. He glanced down at his prosthetic arm, and a wave of realization washed over him. The hidden mechanisms he had designed, once only known to him as the blueprints he had meticulously pored over and memorised, now lay overlaid in his mind over his arm.

With a simple thought, he imagined the blade extending from his forearm just as he would have moved a finger, and it obeyed, gliding fluidly from its sheath. Each flick of his mental switch brought an immediate response: the blade extending, retracting, shifting with precision— a delicate waltz of metal and sinew. Arche watched as the world faded into insignificance around Zel'eon, leaving only the exhilaration of becoming one with his creations. He smiled with exhilaration as the soft hum of the world outside began to stir, as if heralding the adventures that awaited Zel'eon, Arche, Saziver, and Senzorin.
# Experience Points
Zel'eon, Senzorin, Arche, and Saziver gain 150xp each for their success in stealing the experimental orichalcum chip from the EchoTech transport without the Peakers or EchoTech finding out. The team now have a total of 150xp each.

=== Session 02 (06 April 2024).md ===
- Zel'eon stands outside his clinic with Dregdul the morning after the robbery, looking at the skid marks on the road and discussing how they will handle being under attack from the Peakers
- Saziver wakes up in a cold sweat and immediately checks if EchoTech is tracking the chip - they are not, but they are tracking an assault rifle that Arche took from one of the guards, and a helmet that they have lost signal of
- Zel'eon cooks breakfast for Arche, Senzorin, Dregdul, and Saziver, who arrives at Zel's clinic after he is called over
- As Saziver expounds the importance of getting rid of the assault rifle as soon as possible, there is a knock at the front doors of the clinic. Zel'eon goes to see an EchoTech employee, a bulky dark skinned middle aged woman with completely white hair in a finely made black suit, standing outside his clinic.
- The woman tells Zel'eon that EchoTech knows the assault rifle is with them, and enquires if Zel'eon happened to take anything else from the scene. After Zel'eon denies it, the woman gets extremely suspicious and threatens him, but after gaining no ground, she tells him that she will be back.
- Zel'eon, thinking they know he has the chip, goes upstairs to his workshop and destroys all evidence of the chip as best he can. Saziver and Senzorin prepare to leave to avoid any trouble with EchoTech.
- Zel'eon and Arche wait at the clinic's entrance for EchoTech to arrive, intending to avoid a fight and give them what they want. However, as they are surprised by the glass front door breaking as armed EchoTech guards storm in, Arche accidentally sends the medical gauze wrapped assault rifle in her arms towards one of the guards, shattering his HUD goggles.
- Arche and Zel'eon try and surrender immediately, kneeling at gunpoint while the EchoTech employee sends one of the guards up to search the rest of the clinic. She gets a message from him and gets a delighted look on her face, and asks Arche and Zel where the chip is. Zel'eon manages to convince her he has no idea what she is talking about, but Arche suddenly switches her way of talking to a haughty voice and refuses to answer any of EchoTech's questions, leading to the woman growing impatient as they prepare to leave, taking Arche with them.
- Zel'eon suddenly spies Senzorin's motorcycle passing by the front of the clinic and shouts out for help. Senzorin, with Saziver as his pillion, swerves left and blasts through the front of the clinic, knocking down the EchoTech employees. As this was happening, the guard who was holding them at gunpoint smacks Arche across the face with the stock of his rifle to knock her out for transport, but instead, something unexpected happens. 
- Arche's vision goes black, and in the blackness she suddenly sees the moon before hearing a soft voice in her head that simply states "Shoot yourself, Luvia." She grabs the barrel of the guards assault rifle and puts it to her head, and as the trigger depresses by itself, Arche's head is blown back and white glowing crystals shoot out of the wound. Arche opens her eyes, revealing them to be a pure white, before shouting an incantation in some ancient language at the guard who doubles over and begins vomiting blood and black sludge.
- Saziver hops off the back of the motorcycle and quickly hacks the remaining guard's phone, making it seem as if his wife just texted him saying that she is cheating on him and that he is the ugliest man she has ever met. The guard pulls out his phone and clutches his hair, yelling in anguish before fainting. However, that is what only Saziver sees; the others in the room watch as what actually happens is Saziver stares at the man, eyes bulging, and the man is suddenly frozen in place as he opens his mouth to scream. The guard's eyes roll back in his skull and he drops to the floor head first with a sickening crunch, dead before he even hit the floor.
- The EchoTech lady tries to clamber over the front counter of a clinic to read an incantation from her phone and cast a spell to get her out of there, but Zel'eon slices her Achilles tendon and she goes stumbling to the floor. She crawls over to a wall and begs for mercy, but Zel informs her this is the price she pays for breaking his door. With a thrust through the middle of her skull, Zel'eon's blade severs her brain stem and ends her begging.
- The four of them realise that EchoTech is going to be after them now that they know the chip is with Zel and that they killed three of their employees. They decide to flee to the neighbouring city of Ilrinia.
- Saziver and Arche go visit Saziver's mentor, an orc called Both Steeljaw. As Saziver tells him what happened, he grows grave and unexpectedly calls Saziver's mind back to the power the rest saw him use in the clinic. He tells Saziver that EchoTech has hired him as Both has recently discovered that he has psionic abilities because an individual with psionic abilities has a chance to pass them on to someone else after prolonged close contact. Both suspects Saziver has developed psionic abilities, and tells him as much. Saziver is shocked, but puts it out of his mind for now, telling Both that he needs him to talk to Saziver's parents for him to explain why he is moving to Ilrinia. Both agrees, and hugs Saziver, wishing him luck.
- Zel'eon goes to Dregdul's auto body shop, where he tells his friend what happened and that he has to leave. Dregdul understands but tells Zel'eon to follow him as he has a gift for him. Dregdul gives him an expanding metal shield implant to go on his arm. It is unfinished, as Dregdul intended to work on it with Zel'eon.
- Saziver devises a cover for the four of them as exchange students to Arbalest Academy in a suburban neighbourhood of Ilrinia. 
- Senzorin gathers what possessions he wishes to take, including a bunch of cash, and the four of them get into a car stolen from the apartment's parking garage, before leaving.
=== Session 03 (20 April 2024).md ===
# 2300hrs, 31st of Eternae 1892, Uroim
- After stealing the car from Senzorin's apartment complex garage, the four of them head off towards the causeway between Mosskach and Ilrinia
- Arche suddenly passes out, seeing a full moon in a dark night sky all around her. An androgynous figure appears out of the moon and comes towards her, greeting Arche by her birth name Luvia. The figure reveals herself as the moon goddess Ruatis, and tells Arche that she is the first worshipper of Ruatis in many years. Ruatis tasks Arche with spreading word of Ruatis.
- Arche snaps awake and tells the rest she met God.
- Saziver realises EchoTech can probably track them by their enchanted orichalcum chips in their phones and electronic devices. Everyone upon hearing this, immediately throws their phones away. Saziver however, doesn't want to lose his cyberdeck, his only means of surveillance and his primary mode of communication.
	- Saziver disassembles it and keeps the non orichalcum components, passing the EchoTech manufactured parts to Senzorin.
- Senzorin speeds off and tosses the orichalcum parts into a nearby car, whose window is open because the fat dwarf driver within is smoking out the window. The dwarf, in rage, pulls a gun and fires on Senzorin.
- Arche acts quickly and pulls out one of her collapsible spears of elven make and throws it at the dwarf's car's back left wheel. It punctures the tyre and the car skids off the road. The party speeds off and continues towards the causeway. (50xp)
# 0100hrs, 1st of Mistfall 1892, Ruatis
- The party encounters some trouble at the customs after an EchoTech operative notices Zel'eon's prosthetic arm matching the description of the EchoTech fugitives, but they evade detection and speed off towards Ilrinia. (50xp)
- After arriving in Ilrinia, they refuel their vehicles at a gas station, though noticing that Ilrinia gas stations are a little bit odd. The fuel pumps are manned by automatons, constructs of steel that are animated by magic.
	- They take a break, realising how tired they are from being up all night and fighting just a few hours ago, and decide to find a place to stay. Senzorin decides to bring them to his childhoof home, a skyscraper in the city centre.
- They drive to the central district of Ilrinia, a place filled with skyscrapers and corporations named the Core. However, upon arriving at the skyscraper where the Talos family penthouse is meant to be, the doorman turns them away and tells them nobody by the name of Talos is in te building, and couldn't let anyone random in even if there was.
# 0300hrs, 1st of Mistfall 1892, Ruatis
- The group, in absence of any other plans, decide to head to Arbalest Academy to try and find some place to stay. Senzorin drives them one by one on his motorcycle as the car they took broke down right outside the Talos address. As they arrive outside the school, they all pass out on the grass right outside the front gates.
	- Arche, having to sleep less than the rest, notices a lanky figure sneak into the school and mess with their metal detector, before slinking off into the night.
- The four of them wake up to the principal of the school, John de Bolbec, greeting them. He tells them to head inside with him, and that they can settle accomodations for them.

=== Session 04 (11 May 2024).md ===
# 1000hrs, 1st of Mistfall, Ruatis
Principal John de Bolbec, a tall, lithe middle aged man with blood red eyes, is the first thing Zel'eon, Saziver, Senzorin, and Arche see as they wake up on the front lawn of Arbalest Academy. Still bleary eyed and sleep deprived, they gather the meagre possessions they brought to Ilrinia and follow the principal into the school. 

Senzorin runs into his first Ilrinian obstacle when he is told weapons are not allowed to be on school property and he has to submit his cutlass and revolvers to the security guard before he is allowed in. The rest of the group first try to convince him to give them up, but when they are unsuccessful in the face of Senzorin's paranoia, manage to convince the principal to let him bring in his weapons just for today.

In the principal's office, the four are immediately confronted by Principal John who has seen through their ruse, stating that there is no way exchange students would be permitted to join the Academy so late in their final year. However, he realises they are still exhausted from their escape from Mosskach, and let them go to their housing to rest for the day. The four are suitably chastened and promise to return the next day with a full retelling of their stories.

Later, at their student housing (a two story house just behind Arbalest Park), the group has a discussion about what they should tell the principal. They realise the consequences could be dire, namely EchoTech finding out they are in Ilrinia and hunting them down, and so decide to tell the principal everything. They are about to turn in for the night when they hear a commotion in the direction of the school.

Despite their aching bodies, they run towards the noise, through Arbalest Park. The noise they heard, seemingly of a fight, has quietened down, though they still hear raised voices coming from the pond. They stop short under the cover of the treeline just before the pond as they realise the source of the voices - a squadron of Ilrinian policemen that seem to have just arrived at the scene. The pond in the middle of the park is filled with green and red blood floating up from the depths, and its source is revealed when

# 2nd Mistfall 1892 - 5th Mistfall 1892
Senzorin takes inventory of his possessions brought from Mosskach; He is left with a comfortable amount of money, 5 pistols, and barely any spare ammo left. He decides to roam Ilrinia, looking for anything to do other than school. He manages to find a decent amount of symbols and signs in Thieves' Cant - a secret system of disseminating information for those who still adhere to the archaic concept of honour among thieves - denoting safehouses, potential targets, and dangerous places. He is unable to worm his way into any of the marked safehouses, but does notice that many of the manholes in Dunwich are marked with the danger symbol.

Saziver dives into school headfirst, even joining an extracurricular club in the form of the Computer Club. He spots one of the friends he makes there, a wiry half-orc sophomore named Zammar, using orichalcum traces in his circuit boards, piquing his interest as he had heard of the difficulty of obtaining orichalcum in Ilrinia due to EchoTech not wanting other magitech companies to crop up. He manages to convince Zammar to tell him where he got the orichalcum, but the half-orc tells him to wait until Udis and to expect him at Saziver's house for the information.

Zel'eon uses his time in his design and technology classes to further refine and rework his implants. He manages to come up with a new design for his leg implants that could boost his agility. In the rest of his time, he studies the orcs of Ilrinia, in particular their differences from the larger population of orcs in Mosskach. He finds out that the Ilrinian orcs have mostly gotten here through wealth and assimilation into Ilrinian society, and therefore behave very differently from what he is used to. He also borrows some money from Senzorin to pick up some healing potions for the party.

Zammar shows up at the group's doorstep, telling them that his father is the one who got the orichalcum, having connections to the orcs in Mosskach. He intended to use it to manufacture magitech in Ilrinia on par with EchoTech's products, but it was stolen a few days ago by an unknown party. He directs the party to his house, which is where his father works out of, and reminds them not to let it lead back to him. 

The party heads to the orc's house to check it out, and finds some tracks leading to a sewer grate behind the house. They deduce that the sewers beneath Arbalest must contain some sort of hideout for the thieves and they decide to find a way into it to retrieve the orichalcum for themselves.

Arche heads to the library and finds that the only way to get access to a map of the sewers beneath the city was to enter the library archives. Senzorin scouts the library and finds a limited number of options into the archives. Arche finds out that she can gain access to the library if she passes a free course held by the National Library, but that the waiting list for the course would mean that she would have to wait some weeks for a slot.

The group decides to try and scout out one of the sewer entrances nearby their house. They pry open a manhole and head down the ladder, landing in ankle deep sewer water. As they begin searching for any entrances or exits, they are suddenly attacked by two armed ratfolk.

# Session Recap
## The Sewer Tunnels
It's the middle of the afternoon on Udis, the 6th of Mistfall 1892. Zel'eon, Arche, [Senzorin](https://aenyrathia.wiki/PCs/Senzorin%20Talos), and [Saziver](https://aenyrathia.wiki/PCs/Saziver%20Copper-Fern) are navigating the sewers beneath [Arbalest](https://aenyrathia.wiki/World%20Info/Locations/Ilrinia/Arbalest), following the trail of a stolen chunk of orichalcum. After defeating a group of ratfolk guards, the party takes a moment to recover. Frustrated by his inability to see in the dark like the rest of the party, Zel'eon dismantles his flashlight, exposing its electronics, and implants it under his collarbone, allowing him to control the light at will. They notice a sewer tunnel on the far wall with sawed-off iron bars and a rusted alarm bell beside it.

Arche and Saziver search the ratfolk corpses and find a rough map, a small vial of murky liquid, and a string necklace adorned with rat bones and teeth. They determine the map shows the layout of the ratfolk hideout, the vial is a weak healing potion, and the necklace is a protective talisman. Zel'eon attempts to harvest body parts for implants but fails due to his inexperience with ratfolk anatomy.
## Into The Barracks
Upon examining the tunnel, they find it trapped with a tripwire connected to the alarm bell. Senzorin disarms the trap and removes the bell, while Zel'eon stores the rusted screws and some sewer sludge in a vial, loading it into his arm cannon. The party then crawls through the tunnel, moving as quietly as possible. Their caution pays off as they emerge into the ratfolk barracks, taking the occupants by surprise. They quickly dispatch three unarmed ratfolk and a trained giant rat. 

The room is filled with straw mats and threadbare blankets, with a small cooking fire burning weakly in the corner. Senzorin notices an unconscious man tied to a post in the middle of the room and approaches him. Arche revives the man with a healing potion, who introduces himself as [Dalen Blackwell](https://aenyrathia.wiki/World%20Info/People/Dalen%20Blackwell), an executor for the [Council of Arcaneum](https://aenyrathia.wiki/World%20Info/Organisations/Council%20of%20Arcaneum). He explains that he was ambushed and brought down here to provide information about the surface to the ratfolk leader. He assumes the Council had received his distress [Message](https://5e.tools/spells.html#message_phb) and had sent the party to rescue him, telling them about the leader, Verminlord Skratch, who wields a powerful magical amulet. The party corrects him and tells him they were not sent by the council, but withhold their intentions of claiming the orichalcum and promise to return and free Dalen later.
## Potions and Traps
They proceed up a narrow stairway to an alchemical laboratory. The room is filled with wooden shelves crammed with ingredients and a workbench covered in scrolls and equipment. A ratfolk alchemist, upon seeing the party, chitters and flees through a north door. The party decides to investigate the lab first before pursuing.

Arche finds a locked glass cabinet containing potions. Senzorin tries to pick the lock but fails due to its crude ratfolk engineered mechanism being something wholly unfamiliar to him. Arche and Saziver search for a key, finding it on the workbench, but Zel'eon smashes the lock with his blade. Inside, they find two [healing potions](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20healing_dmg), a [potion of fire breath](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20fire%20breath_dmg), and a [potion of poison resistance](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20poison%20resistance_dmg). They also discover a scroll of [Ray of Sickness](https://5e.tools/spells.html#ray%20of%20sickness_phb) and a hidden vial labelled [Essence of Nightshade](https://5e.tools/items.html#basic%20poison%20(vial)_phb).

Not wanting to carry the alchemical ingredients into their fight with the Verminlord, the party follows the alchemist’s trail. They spot and disarm a tripwire, and Saziver notices a trap in the floor. He determines that lighter individuals like himself can safely cross it and volunteers to go first and open the door for the others to jump through.
## Against the Verminlord
The party prepares for battle: Senzorin coats his cutlass in Essence of Nightshade, Zel'eon drinks the potion of poison resistance, and everyone drinks their remaining healing potions. Saziver opens the door, narrowly avoiding an alchemical fire trap, and they see Verminlord Skratch on a throne of debris, taunting them. The ratfolk alchemist stands beside him, ready with more bombs.

The battle begins with Saziver mentally restraining Skratch as Senzorin strikes him. Zel'eon as his blade impacts the Verminlord, blasting Skratch behind his throne. Their preparations pay off as they deal a decisive first blow to Skratch, who scrambles to his feet and takes cover behind his throne, realising he may have met his match. The alchemist takes pot shots at the members of the party as they dart around, trying to evade his alchemical bombs. 

Panicking, Skratch summons rats from the earth to distract the party, but as they burrow up, Zel'eon slays each of them in quick order. Advancing on the Verminlord, they wear him down as he unsuccessfully tries to hide behind his minions. Eventually, Saziver breaks through his mental armour and grasps hold of his mind, crushing it in a psionic blow that finally defeats the Verminlord. 

The party's battle was not over, however; the ratfolk alchemist, seeing his master fall, wails in fear and grabs the amulet from his neck, running past the party and attempting to flee the throne room. The party, however, do not let the alchemist escape, and executes him as he attempts to pass by them. Finally having cleared the ratfolk hideout, they take a moment to heal their injuries, as well as to search for the orichalcum chunk they came here to find. 
## To The Kriminals Go The Loot
Rummaging through the trash heap behind the throne, they find a small chest containing not only said orichalcum, but also several jewels and gemstones that appeared to have been ripped out from discarded jewellery. Gathering up their spoils, they begin making their way back to the barracks where Dalen still sits, picking up all the valuables from the laboratory that they can carry. 

Upon reaching the barracks, they decide not to free Dalen just yet. Instead, Zel'eon fashions a contraption out of some scrap metal that will cut through the ropes tying him to the post in an hour. Senzorin warns Dalen not to contact them, but the man simply regards the party with amusement. He congratulates them on their victory, and tells them it was no small feat to defeat the Verminlord, especially for relative novices. 

The party takes this as a sign of disrespect and insult Dalen for being captured in the first place, before leaving him to be freed by Zel'eon's contraption. Making their way back up the sewer entrance, the party finally emerges into the evening light of Ilrinia, having successfully accomplished their goal of acquiring some orichalcum. They make their way back to their student housing, exhausted from the day.

# Session Recap
## Aftermath
It's evening on Udis, the 6th of Mistfall 1892. Following their battle against Verminlord Skratch, the party heads out of the sewers into an Arbalest street. Suddenly, they notice a group of Council guards marching purposefully. These guards were sent to rescue Dalen, but the party decides to keep a low profile and avoid any confrontation.

As they continue, Senzorin makes a quick stop at Greenwich to use some of the money from his stash to get some pearls to add to the ones they got from the ratfolk hideout. Getting back to the house, Arche uses these pearls to identify the magic items they got from their adventure. Although they are weary from the day, the party can't sleep. Saziver is in the living room watching Blood Bowl on the TV when he notices a familiar voice commentating the match; Both Steeljaw. Noticing Saziver's pain at being separated from his father figure, Senzorin uncharacteristically gives him a pat on the back. 

## Weakness of My Flesh
Zel'eon, on the other hand, is in his room that he is in the process of converting into a workshop. Still frustrated by his all too human capabilities, and by the limitations of his implants being worn over his actual limbs, he decides to take a leap of faith. A scream of pain echoes through the neighbourhood, as the rest of the party rushes to Zel'eon's room, watching as he clamps a new prosthetic arm in place of his left arm. 

Senzorin, having been interrupted in one of his rare moments of prayer, stares in shock at Zel'eon's unexpected act, when he hears a knock on the front door downstairs. Leaving the rest of the party in Zel'eon's room, he sees Ellipses, their neighbour, at the front door. With most of the neighbourhood in their front yard, Senzorin successfully convinces Ellipses nothing is wrong, and Ellipses turns to tell the rest of the neighbours to go back to their houses.
## Plot Thickening
The next day, Saziver and Zel'eon are out running some errands. While enjoying some Red Dragon Bites they receive a letter delivered by a pale-skinned blonde courier from the Council. The letter, from Dalen Blackwell, instructs them to meet outside the central power grid hub at 4 pm and to bring the amulet. The letter uses their school record names: Zel'eon Talis, Senzorin, Saziver Copper-Fern, and Arche Kagekiyo.

Meanwhile, Senzorin and Arche go to the Iron Horse Tavern, where Senzorin saw a Thieves' Cant symbol denoting a fence. They manage to sell their gemstones for $500 to a pot-bellied, bald, middle-aged fence who constantly chews gum. They also meet a Miskatonic University student named Jack, a brunette young man with a sad demeanor, at the bar they meet the fence at. Afterwards, they receive word from Saziver and Zel'eon about Dalen Blackwell’s message.

The party regroups at their house to discuss the letter. They decide to meet with the executor, planning to hand over the amulet since they weren't planning on using it anyway. Before meeting him though, the party decides to check if the car they used to drive to Ilrinia from Mosskach was still parked outside the skyscraper and, finding it there, they drive back to the house to plan their next steps.
## Mind Over Matter
At 4 pm, they meet Dalen across the street from the central power grid hub. Dalen tells them they proved their worth in clearing the ratfolk hideout, and wants to offer them an opportunity to prove themselves further. One of the wardstones that prevent extraplanar travel in and out of Ilrinia and the surrounding regions has gone missing. This is not a huge blow to Ilrinia's wards, as the Council has had centuries to build in failsafes and contingencies. However, the wardstone is still a powerful magical artifact and could be deadly in the wrong hands.

Dalen tells the party to find the wardstone and report who stole it and why to him. He directs them to the central power grid hub across the street, telling them that it was where the wardstone was kept and to start investigating there. The party is still mistrustful of him, but he mostly pays no mind, with the exception of Senzorin, who he approaches, much to the latter's chagrin. 

Senzorin realises that Dalen is somehow speaking to him without using his mouth, and is taken aback. As the party looks on in confusion, Dalen directs Senzorin through a mental exercise where he becomes aware of a small nubbin in the back of his mind. After piercing it, he feels a rush of magical energy flow through him, and is suddenly able to perform a small act of telekinesis, shocking his friends, and himself. Dalen smiles and tells Senzorin that this should help during the investigation, and leaves the party there on the Uroim afternoon, looking towards the central power grid hub.
=== Session 08 (1 June 2024).md ===
# Session Recap
The party enters the central power grid hub and encounters a security checkpoint. Here, they are forced to give up their weapons before entering the hub proper. After being frisked and scanned for magical items, they proceed upstairs to meet with the head of security, Caeda Caiwenys. Caeda, a stern yet competent elf, lets them scrub through her security footage on a crystal orb. They discover that a minor explosion occurred in a maintenance zone adjacent to the control room. Zooming in, they see a tiny clockwork automaton causing the explosion. The theft itself happened invisibly, with the wardstone chamber's surveillance crystal showing the wardstone being lifted off its pedestal, placed into what appeared to be a bag of holding, and replaced with a replica. Caeda berates herself for not investigating it further and directs the party to speak to Gilbert Gearboot, the chief engineer, for more information.

The party heads down to the control room, where they encounter the head magister, Luw Xei. His haughty demeanor and refusal to look at the party is off-putting at first. However, Senzorin realizes it's a front, as Luw Xei feels outraged that a group of teenagers is investigating the theft he failed to prevent. Senzorin charms Luw Xei into believing he will be credited as critical to the investigation, thereby saving face with the Council. Luw Xei reveals that whoever made the replica of the wardstone must be a powerful magician or artificer, as it was so convincing that they did not realize the theft had occurred for days.

The party proceeds to the maintenance zone and meets the chief engineer, Gilbert Gearboot, a gnome tinkerer. Combing the maintenance zone, they find parts of the clockwork automaton. Gilbert recognizes the work as belonging to Azura Glimmerwrench, a talented artificer with the Department of Arcane Innovation. Azura has been missing for some weeks after presenting an invention to her peers and being mocked cruelly for it.

Deciding to find Azura, the party heads to the Department of Arcane Innovation. They face a labyrinth of workshops and offices, but Saziver successfully spots the pattern and leads the party toward Azura's workshop. They move through the twisting hallways, coming upon a display area called the Hall of Theoretical Magitech, showcasing inventions like Aetheric Communicators, Self-Heating Culinary Utensils, and Luminary Orbs.

Eventually, they find Azura's workshop, identified by a plaque reading "Azura Glimmerwrench, Experimental Magitech." They break in, but a clockwork sentinel in the corner fires a whirring blade at them. The party disables the sentinel and investigates the room, finding books on extraplanar energies, blueprints for various magitech, and a hidden journal detailing Azura's plans to activate her invention, the Extraplanar Resonator, at an abandoned celestial observatory in the city. With the full moon approaching in a few hours, they realize Azura plans to use the wardstone's energies to open a rift between planes. Zel'eon identifies flaws in her design and insists they must stop her.

The party rushes to the observatory in the northeast of the city, arriving a few hours before midnight. Using a cloak of invisibility found in the workshop, they scout the observatory and find Azura guarded by several clockwork automata, having finished building the Extraplanar Resonator. Reporting to Dalen, he congratulates them and tells them to await a strike team. Doubting the team's timely arrival, the party decides to take down Azura themselves.

They lure Azura downstairs with a promise of connecting to a deity, and spring a trap, paralyzing her with a spell and attempting to knock her unconscious. As Senzorin and Arche try to gouge out her mechanical eye, Zel'eon stops them, enraged by their brutality. They knock her unconscious and put her in their car, deciding to keep her alive to mentor them in magitech.

Returning to the central power grid hub, they ask Gilbert for help but are rebuffed. Calling Dalen Blackwell, he surprises them by appearing from the shadows. He commends their bravery and admits the Council never planned severe punishment for Azura. He promises to see if it can be arranged for them to study under her and sends them home to rest after a job well done. The party, satisfied with their success and newfound loot, heads back to their home in Arbalest, ready to rest and prepare for their next adventure.

# Session Recap
## Downtime (8th of Mistfall 1892 - 21st of Mistfall 1892)

After defeating Azura Glimmerwrench on the 7th of Mistfall 1892, Zel'eon, Arche, Saziver, and Senzorin enjoy a much-needed break, getting to properly enjoy life in Ilrinia. The four are slowly getting used to not having their guard up all the time, as they had to in Mosskach, and are also dealing with some inter-party tension due to how some of the party handled things with Azura.
### Saziver Copper-Fern

Saziver Copper-Fern, still having his sights set on going to a good university, put his nose to the grindstone and studied hard at the Arbalest Academy. He also used the orichalcum liberated from the ratfolk hideout to create communication devices for the party that could connect to the internet and serve as a peer-to-peer encrypted communication network between themselves. He spent most of his time away from the rest of the party, holed up in his room other than at mealtimes, working on finding ways to exploit the surveillance network of Ilrinia and honing his subconscious psionic abilities to always be aware and alert of any threats around him.

### Arche Kagekiyo

Arche Kagekiyo began practicing with the spear that is all she has left from her Ilrinian childhood. Every night, she goes through her Bellona clan-taught combat forms, both as exercise and as a way to reconnect with her elvish heritage. Senzorin takes note of this and correctly guesses that she is, after being back in Ilrinia after so long, thinking about her childhood as a high-born sun elf, the same as Senzorin. The two of them bond over their shared heritage, and Senzorin begins to think about reconnecting with his own heritage. Arche also spends time at the library after school, gravitating toward the self-help section to practice social skills.
### Senzorin Talos

Senzorin Talos, not having to worry about earning his own money for the first time in a while, spends a lot of his time high and watching television at home. Despite disliking school, he enjoys his marksmanship lessons, practicing using his cutlass in tandem with his revolver. He also practices his telekinesis more, gradually being able to manifest an entire external body that works subconsciously, though it can only perform simple tasks. He uses it to automate menial tasks, like taking the load off of Arche always having to wash the dishes. Senzorin also gets a patchwork tattoo sleeve of various animals, gaining the ability to summon them as familiars.
### Ellipses Seventhtime

Ellipses Seventhtime, who lived in the house next to Zel'eon, Saziver, Senzorin, and Arche, decided to visit them more frequently over the period. Senzorin had previously contacted Ellipses to help him grow the marijuana seeds he had brought over from Mosskach. Ellipses wanted to do more with botany, so he approached Zel'eon asking if he could help set up a plant laboratory to grow alchemical ingredients and psychedelic drugs in his bedroom. He had cleared most of Fenrir's old stuff out of the room and preferred wearing some of the Seventhtimes' old hand-me-downs. Ellipses also discovered a penchant for ingesting metal scraps, finding them delicious.
### Zel'eon Talos

Zel'eon Talos takes a few days to manufacture a quick 3D printer in their house for Saziver to use to manufacture their new communication devices. He also spends some time experimenting with the alchemical reagents gathered from the ratfolk hideout, planning to make more with Ellipses' help to build a place in Ellipses' bedroom to grow more ingredients. Over the two weeks, he also works on a way to implement the wings he scavenged from the clockwork automaton in Azura's workshop into his own body, coming to the realization that he will need to replace part of his own spine with the control box to do so. Zel'eon and Arche work on the surgery and eventually manage to implement the wings as a new implant, granting Zel'eon limited flight capabilities.
### Zel'eon and Senzorin's Car Repair Efforts

Zel'eon and Senzorin also work on trying to repair the car the group drove from Mosskach, but find that since the car, a Talos Sovereign 1843, is a luxury vintage model that was discontinued years ago, parts are out of stock and rare. Discovering that the only car of the same model they could find was owned by a wealthy collector named Victor Ralston, they research the man and find out he frequents a bar for vintage car collectors. They head to the Iron Horse Tavern to speak to Sam, the bartender and a friend of theirs, to ask about the bar. They find out the bar is called the Chrome Lounge and is located at the Platinum Tower, a skyscraper in the Core. However, the bar is invite-only and they give up on their search for now. Saziver helps them find out that Victor has a son studying at Miskatonic University named Jonathan, but they don't find any leads, even after hacking into his private social media.
### Ellipses and Arche at the Library

Ellipses finds out that Arche has been going to the library daily and asks if she can bring him to help research more cases like his. When they get there, they get stopped by a young blonde man outside the library handing out flyers for a free Introduction to Technomancy course conducted by a group called the New Dawn every Ruatis at the Horizon Community Centre. Also, Arche sees Jack, the Miskatonic University student she met at the bar with Senzorin a few weeks prior, and strikes up an awkward conversation. At the end of it, Jack asks her out on a date for the following Uroim, and Arche accepts.

Meanwhile, Ellipses discovers that his case is not the first of its kind, and that this phenomenon is dubbed "Spontaneous Amnesiac Resurrection". Some scholars posit that this may be due to some unknown magical interference, leading to a transference of a soul into the recently deceased body, which tracks with what Ellipses heard from Ekra's mentor. Ellipses also reads about a case of a man who underwent spontaneous amnesiac resurrection and finds that the man was from Elenwyth, a town that is a day's train ride from Ilrinia. The stories about the man seem to end around the year 1200, but Ellipses intends to travel to the town and see what he can find.
## Ruatis, 22nd of Mistfall 1892
### Lunch with Ellipses' Parents

Ellipses' parents, noticing that their son has been spending a lot of time at his neighbors', invite them over for lunch after school. They have a meal of lembas, traditional elvish fare that is rare to find among the mostly modernized elves of Ilrinia, like Arche and Senzorin's families, along with some conversation about the Seventhtimes and the elvish heritage of some in the group. They learn that the Seventhtimes are a candle-making clan. Saziver does not join the lunch, staying at school for extracurriculars.
### New Dawn's Introduction to Technomancy Course

After lunch, the group consisting of Ellipses, Zel'eon, Senzorin, and Arche head to the New Dawn's Introduction to Technomancy course. They drive to the Old City district, where the Horizon Community Centre is located. They spy Luw Xei outside the community center, flanked by a large arcane golem. Telling the magister they are here for the course, he is shocked and tells them the New Dawn are miscreants who want to dismantle the Council, seeking less regulation for mages. The golem scans their faces, confirming their registration for the course, and the group heads inside.

Inside the community center, they see Professor Lyra Valen, a mousy brunette middle-aged woman, at the front of a small lecture theater talking to two Miskatonic University students. The rest of the lecture's attendants include an elderly couple and a few other university students, including Jonathan Ralston, who Senzorin and Zel'eon immediately recognize. Professor Valen launches into a lecture about Technomancy, a discipline that involves encoding magic into circuits, similar to electricity, explaining how although most technomancers outside of EchoTech, who control all the orichalcum, are unable to find conductors that can reliably conduct both electricity and magic, they make do by finding ingenious ways to work around that shortcoming.
### Golem Attack

As she is about to go into detail about these methods, the floor starts rumbling. The doors of the lecture theater suddenly burst open and the golem storms in, moving erratically and sending splinters of wood everywhere as it breaks the floorboards and pews. The students scramble towards Lyra for cover as she casts a forcefield, and the party leaps into action.

Zel'eon and Arche are stuck in the force field Lyra puts up and cannot make any attacks through it while the golem begins pounding at the force field, trying to get to Lyra. Ellipses and Senzorin focus on taking out the core rune of the golem in an attempt to disable it as soon as possible. Ellipses goes down during the battle from an energy blast from the rune but gets back up after Arche manages to channel the power of the New Moon to imbue everyone in the room with holy restorative energy. The combined efforts of Arche and Ellipses manage to shatter the runestone powering and controlling the golem, and it crumbles to bits.

Arche approaches the heavily injured elderly woman whose husband was vaporized in one of the golem's magical force blasts and beseeches Ruatis to shine her light on the woman and heal her. The elderly woman listens to Arche speak about Ruatis and says a heartfelt prayer to Ruatis, the first in centuries other than from Arche.
### Confrontation with Luw Xei

Zel'eon and Senzorin rush outside to confront Luw Xei, who they suspect of deploying the golem on the lecture, though he denies any involvement in the matter. They drag him into the community center, and Zel'eon throws him in front of an angry Lyra, who begins screaming and kicking him, accusing him of sending the golem to attack and kill her. Zel'eon calms her as Arche begins casting a spell that will ensure anyone within speaks only the truth.

They begin to question Luw Xei, but he again denies that he had anything to do with the golem going mad and attacking Lyra. Arche confirms that he is telling the truth, but Lyra insists there is no way a Council golem can possibly be controlled by anyone else other than a Council member and that they were trying to assassinate her and get rid of the New Dawn. The party calls Dalen Blackwell for Council assistance in managing the situation, and upon hearing so, Lyra requests the party to meet her at her estate in Greenwich on the morrow. Additionally, Senzorin cozies up to Jonathan Ralston, who he recognized earlier, and realizes Jonathan is flirting with him. He leverages this to get Jonathan's phone number in an attempt to later use it to find a way to access Victor Ralston's Talos Sovereign 1843.
### Arrival of Council Security Forces

The Council's security forces arrive at the community center and begin cordoning it off. Dalen walks in, and icy greetings are shared between him and Lyra, prompting the party to make comments about a possible scorned lover situation between the two. Dalen and Lyra immediately react in disgust, telling the party they are related, which promptly makes the party profusely apologize in shame.

Dalen pulls the party outside and requests a full debrief. He shakes his head and tells the party he suspects the New Dawn had something to do with this, in an attempt to garner sympathy for their underdog cause against the Council. He asks the party to speak with him after their visit to Lyra's estate. He also tells the party their actions have gained them some renown, pointing at the attendants of the New Dawn lecture who are arrayed around the safety cordon, telling their family and friends about the party's actions.

The party begins to leave the area and head home, but Senzorin cannot resist one last jab at Dalen. He reaches out a telekinetic hand to poke Dalen on the shoulder, but the moment he brushes against him, he feels a ringing telekinetic slap on his face. The party heads home to find Saziver and discuss the situation.
# Experience Points and Reputation

For defeating the Council golem that attacked the New Dawn lecture and saving multiple innocents from dying, Ellipses, Senzorin, Arche, and Zel'eon gain 450xp each, levelling up Ellipses to character level 3. Additionally, 5 reputation was gained with the New Dawn and the Council of Arcaneum factions, and 10 with the city of Ilrinia to represent word being spread of the party's deeds.
# Loot
## Magic Items
### Saziver's Smartphones
Wondrous item, uncommon
- **Encrypted Communication**: The primary feature of this device is its ability to establish an encrypted communication network between all Orichalcum Communication Devices within a 10-mile radius. This network allows for secure voice calls and text messages that cannot be intercepted or deciphered by external sources.
- **Durability**: The device is built to withstand rough handling and minor magical interference. It is resistant to water, minor impacts, and can function in extreme temperatures.
- The device is uniquely linked to its creator, Saziver Copper-Fern. The encryption key for the network is tied to his psionic abilities, making it virtually impossible for anyone outside the party to replicate or access the network without his direct input.
## Miscellaneous
- Various metal scraps collected from the debris of the defeated golem

# Session Recap
## Preparations
It's the 23rd of Mistfall 1892, and the group meets for breakfast, inviting Ellipses to join them. Zel'eon, Senzorin, Arche, and Ellipses fill Saziver in on the previous day's events, including the golem attack at the New Dawn lecture. They decide to follow up on Lyra Valen's invitation to her estate after their classes, hoping to find out what she wants from them.

Before heading to Lyra's estate, Ellipses helps Zel'eon de-rust the Talos Sovereign in their garage and attempts to add a skull to the front of Senzorin's motorcycle, which ends up looking more like a blob. The group stocks up on supplies, with Arche picking up a new rapier. They meet back at the house and head to Greenwich, where Lyra's estate is located.

Upon arrival, they are greeted by a large mansion in an affluent district. A mild-mannered butler welcomes them and brings them to a study in the back of the mansion, where Lyra sits. She greets them warmly and asks for their help in investigating the source of the golem attack from the previous night. She suggests they head to the Horizon Community Center to find any clues about who commandeered and sent the golem to kill her.
## Investigation
Worried the Council investigators wouldn't let them in, Zel'eon calls Dalen for access to the crime scene but hears the sounds of a firefight in the background of the call. Dalen agrees over the sound of a fireball exploding concerningly close to the handphone, and Zel'eon promptly hangs up. 

At the community centre, the security officer, a tall sun elf woman, directs them to the security room. On the second floor, Zel'eon and Saziver scrub through the security footage while Arche and Senzorin search a locked supply cabinet. Arche finds a false bottom with a blueprint of the security system marked with handwritten notes on vulnerabilities. Saziver finds no abnormalities in the footage, but Ellipses discovers a runestone inscribed with a rune of altered perception in the trash, indicating the footage had been magically tampered with.

Zel'eon notices an escape route on the blueprint leading to a vent on the roof. He unfurls his wings and flies straight up, crashing through a skylight. The rest of the group rushes downstairs to apologize to the inspector. Zel'eon finds nothing on the roof but notices a ladder leading to an alleyway, where he discovers a letter detailing the golem's location and assurances of the recipient's dedication to magical purity. He returns and hands the letter to the inspector, who identifies the seal of the Council being on the letter. The group takes pictures of the evidence before handing it over and leaves after thanking the inspector and apologising to her once again.

Arche searches the internet for information on groups dedicated to preserving magical purity and finds a website called the Pure Path, condemning technomancy. The site lists an address, and the group heads to the district of Ham Row. Senzorin sends his owl familiar to scout ahead, finding a dilapidated three-story office building. Saziver and Arche sneak to the back entrance while Zel'eon and Ellipses approach the front door.
## Assault
Zel'eon and Ellipses knock on the front door but receive no answer. As they step through, they trigger a trap that knocks them back, shattering the door. Two armed guards appear and point their crossbows at them. Hearing the commotion, Arche, Saziver, and Senzorin sneak in from the back and attack the guards, quickly dispatching them, but an arcane golem suddenly bursts through the ceiling, and arcane bolts fire down from above through the hole created by the golem. 

Ellipses, Arche, and Saziver head to the second floor to engage a few mages while Zel'eon and Senzorin take on the golem. After finishing off the golem, Zel'eon and Senzorin head upstairs to see the fight wrapping up, only to find Ellipses missing.

Ellipses had headed up the stairs to the third floor, finding a door that was left slightly ajar. He pulls it open, and is immediately attacked with two javelins. He sees two figures in the room, a spellcaster sitting calmly behind a desk, and a heavily armoured enforcer, wielding a longsword and a brace of javelins. As the rest of the group hears Ellipses get attacked upstairs, they head up and the group begins battle with Thibault Carroway, the leader of the Purists. 

Saziver incapacitates Thibault, taking over his mind as the rest of the group focus on taking down the enforcer. Ellipses, overcome by a terrifying might, unveils a frightening necrotic form, unfurling two metallic skeletal wings, causing the enforcer to run in fright. Zel'eon and Senzorin manage to dispatch him, and the group turn to Thibault. Ellipses, still in his terrifying visage, tells him to stand down, and Thibault sits back down behind his desk, defeated. 

They begin questioning him, trying to find out whether this group was involved in the golem attack on Ruatis. Thibault laughs, and although he does not outright say it, he reveals the Purists were not actually the ones who carried out the attack. The group, frustrated with his reticence, knock him out and begin carrying him downstairs, planning to bring him to Lyra.

# Session Recap
## The Offices of the Purists

On the 23rd of Mistfall 1892, Zel'eon and Arche stand in the offices of the Purists after defeating their leader, Thibault Carroway. They realize the extent of the slaughter they had performed, with Arche feeling a twinge of disappointment through her link with Ruatis. Nevertheless, they begin searching the building for clues regarding the Purists' motivations and their involvement in the terrorist attack on the New Dawn the previous day.

In Thibault's office, they find his spellbook, journal, and a ledger detailing the finances of the Purists. The spellbook seems of no immediate use, so they stash it and focus on the journal and ledger. The ledger reveals that the Purists had been steadily losing funds and members since their formation, with a series of anonymous cash transfusions starting three months ago and lasting two months being the only notable entry. Thibault's journal mentions a person named Celeste, valuable to the organization, though no women were encountered during their raid.

Zel'eon finds a treasure trove of alchemical supplies in the artificer's workshop, including a recipe for synthesizing alchemical fire and tools for creating and maintaining golems. Meanwhile, Arche searches the meeting room on the second floor and finds a large locked cabinet and a potions case. After Senzorin picks the padlock on the cabinet, Arche finds that the cabinet still resists any attempt to open it. Realising there must be some sort of ward protecting it from being opened, she begins devising a spell to reverse the enchantment while the rest finish searching the building.

On the first floor, the group finds reconnaissance documents on multiple magitech companies within Ilrinia, Lyra Valen's estate, and even EchoTech's operations in Mosskach. These documents, however, detail incoherent plans to sabotage or assault these locations. Zel'eon, noticing at this point that Senzorin is barely standing on his feet, sends him off with Ellipses to get some rest. He heads upstairs with Saziver, noticing Arche putting the final touches on her spell.

The cabinet swings open to reveal a mannequin dressed in a black bodysuit with silvery metal armour plates sewn in. Arche, recognizing the metal as mithril, tries on the suit and finds it almost fits her perfectly. Wearing the mithril body armour under her regular clothes, Arche heads out of the building onto the now empty street. The group leaves in their rented car, taking the unconscious Thibault Carroway to Lyra's estate.

Arriving at Lyra's estate under the light of the new moon, they inform her of the situation. Lyra is shocked at the sight of Thibault and bids the party come in for an explanation. They skirt around the fact that they killed the rest of the Purists, and Lyra tells them to head back home while she deals with the situation. The party returns to their house in Arbalest, exhausted from the day, and get a good night's rest.
## Arche's Crisis

Arche enlists Zel'eon, who makes a call to Dalen Blackwell to see if he can help them get to the rooftop of the Peak, a skyscraper owned by the Sylvan corporation. He tells them he doesn't have quite as much sway as they assumed, but he could get them a meeting with someone in Sylvan. Indeed, as they are on the way to the Peak, they receive a message from Dalen telling them they have a meeting with an Arthur Truges, an executive in Sylvan.

Heading into the Peak, Arche and Zel'eon speak to the receptionist and are directed to Arthur's office on the 80th floor. Speaking to the executive, they find that the only way they can convince him to get access to the rooftop is to help him out with something he needs; hunting a beast called the Storm Serpent, sacred to a tribe of wood elves in the jungle of Alwahd. Knowing that she was on a time limit to complete the ritual by midnight, Arche convinced Arthur to provide transport, as well as some equipment that would help them hunt the Storm Serpent. 

Zel'eon and Arche head back down to the first floor of the Peak, finding an awaiting helicarrier with accompanying pilot. They pile in, finding a bag of holding, two insulating suits as well as a split bladed sword, requested by Arche. The transport takes them over the city's skyline, depositing them on the edge of the jungle. They slowly make their way through the vegetation, finding charred trees and electrified puddles, as the sky got darker around them and the ambient static electricity levels slowly increased.

Eventually, the pair comes upon a large, ancient tree hollow that is surrounded by the electrified puddles that have become common on their hunt. Arche suddenly spots two silver eyes staring at them from the underbrush and tells Zel'eon to freeze. The two get ready, Zel'eon unfurling his wings, as they prepare for battle.

Arche channels the power of the new moon as she and Zel'eon do battle with the Storm Serpent, a titanic snake with silvery, iridescent scales that did its utmost to strike the pair down with strikes of elemental lightning and thunderclaps. The pair does eventually prevail, striking the serpent down and decapitating it. Realising the elves that worship it are sure to investigate soon, they begin carving the serpent's corpse into as small pieces as will fit in their provided bag of holding. 

As they finish stuffing the carved bits of the serpent into the bag, Arche hears sounds coming from the side of the clearing. She quickly tosses a potion of invisibility to Zel'eon, who drinks it and disappears from view, and disappears herself into the underbrush, watching as a small group of wood elves emerge into the clearing. She hears them call out for the storm serpent, but to no avail. Fleeing back to the helicarrier, she hears the keening of the elves, calling out for their missing god. 
### The Ritual

Zel'eon and Arche arrive back at the Peak, heading up to Arthur Truges' office and handing him the bag of holding. As promised, he tells them to head up to the 264th story for rooftop access. As the pair ride the elevator up to the roof, they emerge to a stunning sight; even higher than they were on the helicarrier, they see the new moon shining above them. Arche begins setting up the ritual, drawing the ritual circle out of chalk and moon dust. She kneels at the centre of the circle, and asks Zel'eon to begin.

Zel'eon takes his surgical tools out and heats them with his implants, sterilising them. He steps towards Arche and begins cutting into her left eyeball, extracting it and severing her left optic nerve. He does the same with her right eyeball, as Arche stays kneeling, not even flinching at the pain. As soon as her eyes are removed, she looks up at the moon, seeing it even without vision. She begins beseeching Ruatis, and Zel'eon watches as moonlight begins pooling in her eye sockets, shining out into the night sky. 

As the light fades, he watches as the moonlight coalesces into orbs of silver light inscribed with a symbol - the elvish rune for moon. Arche looks at him and places a hand on his shoulder. Zel'eon looks out at the city skyline and realises he can see in the darkness. Arche turns and looks back towards the centre of the rooftop, where they came from. Zel'eon, turning to see what she is looking at, sees a figure in all white walking towards them. 

As this figure gets closer, it becomes obvious that it is Ruatis. Appearing as a vaguely elvish looking woman dressed in a silvery white gown, she approaches Arche and speaks with her briefly, calling Arche her prophet and telling her to continue her mission and spread word of Ruatis. Ruatis also tells Arche to conduct herself as a prophet would, and to not diminish Ruatis' name among the people of Aenyrathia.

As the goddess disappears, Arche and Zel'eon are left by themselves on the rooftop, alone. Without much further discussion, Zel'eon picks up Arche and unfurls his wings. Stepping off the edge of the rooftop, he glides down, over the city of Ilrinia, landing back at home.

# Recap
## The Press Conference
The soft light of the Zalaris morning filtered through the curtains of Zel’eon and Senzorin’s living room as they lounged on their couch. It's the 25th of Mistfall 1892, the day after Zel'eon and Arche had finished their ritual to Ruatis on the rooftop of the Peak. They watched as a televised press conference delivered by the Council of Arcaneum's Archmage of Divination, Emeline Valeria, announced the findings of the Council regarding the culprits of the golem attack on the Horizon Community Centre on the 22nd of Mistfall. Her voice, crisp and commanding, filled the room as she condemned Thibault Carroway, the leader of the Purists, for his supposed role in the recent golem attack on the Horizon Community Centre. Behind her, Lyra Valen, the leader of the New Dawn, wore a satisfied expression, her pleasure evident as the narrative unfolded.

The two young men exchanged glances. They, along with Saziver, Arche, and Ellipses, had discovered the Purists' incompetence in their machinations, and had surmised they probably weren't the ones behind the golem attack. They had then delivered Carroway to Lyra along with the evidence of this fact. However, a sudden knock at the door interrupted their thoughts.

Zel'eon opened it to find a gift hamper from the Council, brimming with treasures: jars of rare honey, a wheel of dwarven cheese, glimmer berries, and dire boar ham. Accompanying the hamper were two letters—one from Dalen Blackwell, representing the Council, and another from Lyra Valen herself. Dalen's letter expressed congratulations for their brave actions during the golem attack and detailed a reward of 3,000 Ilrinian dollars to be credited to each member of the party. Lyra's letter echoed similar sentiments, thanking them profusely for their assistance in identifying the true culprit behind the chaos at the community centre, along with a reward of 2,000 Ilrinian dollars each.

As they discussed the implications of the Council's intrigue and the New Dawn’s involvement with the Purists, Zel’eon and Senzorin decided to remain detached from the unfolding drama. They agreed that if their help was truly needed, either Dalen and Lyra would reach out to them. With their breakfast finished, they prepared to head to Arbalest Academy, eager for the excitement of combat class. Zel’eon, energized by the prospect of sparring, managed to persuade Senzorin to engage in a one-on-one match for the first time.
## Combat Class
The clash of steel against armour echoed across the training field behind Arbalest Academy as the weekly combat class commenced. Students squared off in intense sparring matches, their teachers trading formal attire for combat-ready gear. Zel’eon, clad in shining white armour that gleamed in the sunlight, stood confidently with his wings unfurled, while Senzorin faced him, feeling unprepared in comparison. He gripped his cutlass in one hand, the other empty, as he fended off a relentless barrage of attacks.

After a few moments, their instructor, Mr. Thorne, called for a pause. He pulled Senzorin aside and urged him to adopt his usual combat stance, suggesting that fighting without his revolver wasn’t natural. Senzorin fired back that he wasn't allowed to carry ammunition into the school, but the manticore told him to try it anyway. As Senzorin settled into his familiar stance, shouldering his cutlass and staying light on his feet, Zel’eon seized the opportunity to strike, lunging forward with fierce determination, relishing the thrill of combat.

Senzorin evaded for a time, but growing weary and in a moment of desperation, instinctively pointed his unloaded revolver at Zel’eon and pulled the trigger. To their astonishment, a bolt of elemental fire shot forth, catching Zel’eon in the chest and sending him stumbling back. Mr. Thorne roared with delight, urging Zel’eon to fight back. Zel’eon regrouped, defending against the barrage of fire that Senzorin unleashed, but soon found himself overwhelmed.

Disoriented and scrambling to regain his focus, Zel’eon slammed his palms onto the ground, unleashing a wave of ice that enveloped Senzorin and sent him crashing to the ground, unconscious. After the match, and with Mr. Thorne’s congratulations still ringing in his ears, Zel’eon carried his friend to the infirmary. As Senzorin regained consciousness, he initially berated Zel’eon for not revealing his magical ability, but then recalled his own feat. Their faces broke into grins as they contemplated the potential of their newfound powers and how to develop them further.
## Senzorin and Jonathan's First Date
Returning home on the afternoon of the 25th of Mistfall, Zel'eon and Senzorin decide to pursue further their plans of getting parts for their broken down vintage sedan, a Talos Sovereign. Senzorin prepared for a date with Jonathan Ralston, a student from Miskatonic University who they had saved during the golem attack, and who Senzorin had been texting over the last few days. Not particularly being interested in the spoiled rich kid, Senzorin's main objective was to glean information about Jonathan’s father, Victor Ralston, who owned a Talos Sovereign similar to the one they wanted to repair. Zel’eon decided to shadow them from the rooftops, eavesdropping on their conversation through an audio channel broadcast from Senzorin’s phone.

The evening air was crisp as Senzorin arrived at the designated meeting spot. Jonathan greeted him warmly, a flirty smile playing on his lips. As their conversation continued through the late afternoon, Zel’eon crouched atop the rooftops, ears tuned into the unfolding date. Through the audio feed, he learned vital information about the exclusive Chrome Lounge, accessible only through a private elevator in one of the Platinum Tower’s sub-basements. Jonathan revealed that his father planned to showcase his Talos Sovereign in just a few days, and the car would be sent to the garage at 3 PM. This new knowledge intrigued the pair, even as Senzorin found himself oddly enjoying the date more than he would have thought he would.
## The Albino Man
After the date concluded, Senzorin and Zel’eon understood they required more details to execute their plan effectively. As the afternoon sun sank below the horizon, casting long shadows over the bustling streets of Ilrinia, the pair made their way to the Iron Horse Tavern, a well-known bar in the Greenwich district that Senzorin knew had ties to the Thieves' Guild.

Upon arriving, Senzorin hesitated outside the tavern, his gaze drifting across the street to a small bubble tea shop. There, he spotted the half-elf woman he had previously tried to charm, only to be rebuffed. Summoning his courage, he decided to give it another shot. This time, fortune smiled upon him; he received a smile and a name - Emily. Bolstered by this small victory, he rejoined Zel’eon at the tavern. They sat at the bar and awaited their chance to speak with someone who could provide the crucial information they needed.

Soon, a portly man emerged from the backroom, his expression sour as he shot Senzorin a pointed glare. Recognizing him as a fence from their previous dealings, Senzorin approached him, inquiring about information regarding the Platinum Tower. The man’s response was curt, his demeanor as unwelcoming as ever, but he directed them to the backroom.

With a nod from Sam, the duo descended a narrow staircase, entering a hidden bar that mirrored the Iron Horse Tavern above. This secretive space was dimly lit and sparsely populated, an unseen force cleaning glasses behind the bar, while a middle-aged albino man sat alone in the middle of the room, observing them with a piercing intensity.

The albino man's gaze seemed to weigh heavily on them as he spoke, requesting a favour in exchange for the information they sought. He revealed that an EchoTech prototype was being held by a gang known as the Avjarn, located in the derelict district of Ham Row. The man provided little else in the way of details, only mentioning that the Avjarn could be identified by their distinctive heavy armour.

Senzorin and Zel’eon stepped out of the tavern, prepared to face whoever - or whatever - this Avjarn was.
## The Avjarn
Senzorin and Zel’eon made their way through the dimly lit streets of Ham Row, where the shadows of abandoned buildings loomed over them. The air carried a chill, thick with the scent of decay and neglect. As they progressed, Senzorin sent his owl familiar into the night, the small creature gliding effortlessly through the darkness to scout ahead. It didn’t take long for the owl to spot a glint of metal in a nearby alley, drawing the pair closer.

Peering into the alley, they saw a group of heavily armoured figures huddled around a table, their faces concealed behind menacing visors. The sight sent a flicker of caution down Zel’eon’s spine. Stepping forward from the cover of shadows, he moved cautiously, wary of the figures’ reaction.

As he approached, the tension in the air thickened, the armoured figures shifting uneasily. One of them rose, flipping up his visor to reveal a middle-aged orc with a weathered face, his skin a rich brown hue decorated with scars that told stories of battles fought. Senzorin and Zel’eon exchanged surprised glances; orcs like him were rarely seen in Ilrinia, especially ones that had not succumbed to the city’s gentrification.

With an air of tentative diplomacy, they introduced themselves, carefully conveying their intentions to speak with the Avjarn’s leader. The brown-skinned orc, introducing himself as Urag, studied them for a moment before nodding, beckoning them to follow. He led them into an abandoned clothing store that concealed a hidden passage leading down to the Avjarn's hideout.

Descending into the basement, they entered a sprawling communal living space where the walls of the former apartment complex had been torn down. The sight stirred a deep empathy within Senzorin and Zel’eon as they listened to Urag recount the Avjarn’s harrowing past—how they had escaped the tyranny of an orc warlord funded by EchoTech, who had unified the tribes of Ibuth to monopolize the orichalcum supply in the region.

Eventually, they were brought before Xugha, the leader of the Avjarn. He was a formidable figure with pitch-black skin, his presence commanding yet cautious. The room he occupied was filled with masterfully crafted weapons and armour, each piece a testament to the Avjarn’s skills, alongside a nondescript padlocked safe tucked away in the corner.

Xugha regarded them with a mix of suspicion and intrigue. The weight of the moment hung in the air as he listened to their story. Slowly, the tension began to dissipate, and his demeanor shifted from guarded to slightly more open, though the underlying caution remained. After a thoughtful pause, he allowed Senzorin and Zel’eon to stay for the night, instructing them to keep the location of the Avjarn’s hideout a secret to protect them from potential reprisal by EchoTech.

As night deepened, the atmosphere inside the Avjarn's hideout transformed into one of warmth and camaraderie. Senzorin and Zel’eon shared hearty drinks with their new companions, the rich flavours of the Orcish brew warming their spirits and easing the strain of the day.

As they conversed, Zel’eon began to notice a stark difference in the Avjarn’s culture compared to the orcs he grew up with in Mosskach. Unlike his kin, who revelled in combat and sparring, these orcs seemed content to build and create, channelling their energies into craftsmanship rather than conflict.

Once the festivities settled and the orcs succumbed to sleep, Senzorin slipped on his cloak of invisibility. He moved quietly through the hideout, the padlocked safe in Xugha’s quarters looming larger in his mind. Yet, as he scouted the space, the thought of stealing from the Avjarn felt increasingly wrong. Each corner he turned revealed scenes of resilience and community, deepening his empathy for their plight and the life they had carved out amidst adversity.

Eventually, Senzorin and Zel’eon returned home, fatigue pulling at their limbs. Sharing a silence, their night with the Avjarn still fresh in their minds, they found themselves questioning their mission. They resolved to seek a different path—one wouldn't jeopardise the Avjarn.
## Hacking into the Platinum Tower
On the 26th of Mistfall, the sun rose brightly over the city as Senzorin and Zel’eon made their way back to the Avjarn hideout. They descended below the hideout to where the Avjarn had carved out a large cavern, setting up their forges. Zel’eon focused intently on his project, making a ceremonial rapier adorned with the elvish symbol of the moon, a birthday gift for Arche. Meanwhile, Senzorin worked on a striking steel full moon, the size of a disco ball. As they hammered away, the conversation inevitably shifted back to their plans. The idea of hacking into the Platinum Tower’s security systems took root in their minds, presenting an opportunity to achieve their goals without harming the Avjarn.

As dusk approached and they left the Avjarn hideout, Senzorin called Jonathan. Jonathan picked up almost instantly, Jonathan’s voice brightening at the sound of Senzorin's name. With his family out of town, Jonathan extended an invitation to his penthouse in the Platinum Tower, providing a chance for Senzorin to gather information. Before parting ways, Senzorin opened a secure audio channel to Zel’eon’s phone, and they split up—Zel’eon heading home while Senzorin made his way to Jonathan’s.

Upon arriving at the penthouse, Senzorin was welcomed into Jonathan’s room, where they shared a passionate encounter that left Senzorin pleasantly surprised by the depth of his enjoyment, despite knowing he had an ulterior motive involving Jonathan’s father. Meanwhile, Zel’eon sat mortified, his face flushed with embarrassment as he listened through the audio channel. The sounds of their intimacy filled the silence, amplifying his discomfort as he tried to focus on the heist they had planned.

After their passionate moments, Jonathan lay peacefully satisfied in bed, and Senzorin seized the opportunity to excuse himself. Quietly, he slipped away to the kitchen where he had previously seen a computer terminal. He hacked into the security systems, gathering vital information about the private parking garage, and sent the details to Zel’eon. With a sigh of relief, he ended the audio communication, returning to Jonathan’s side. They spent the night together, while Zel’eon, mercifully left to his own thoughts, planned the heist for the following day.
## The Heist
The morning of the 27th of Mistfall dawned bright and clear, sunlight streaming through the windows as Senzorin and Zel’eon shared a simple breakfast. The faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the scent of fried dire boar ham filled the air, but their thoughts were focused on the task ahead. With determination etched on his face, Zel’eon leaned across the table, demonstrating the intricate steps required to remove the engine block from their own Talos Sovereign. They had meticulously planned for Senzorin to handle the heist alone, knowing that his agility and stealth far surpassed Zel’eon’s own.

As the afternoon approached, the clock ticked closer to 3:30 PM. Senzorin and Zel’eon arrived at the towering Platinum Tower, its sleek glass façade glinting in the sunlight. Senzorin donned the cloak of invisibility, rendering him nearly undetectable as he slipped through the unarmed fire exit door.

Senzorin descended several flights, pausing at the bottom at the door to the garage. Pushing the door open slowly, it creaked loudly, sending a jolt of panic through him. He froze, holding his breath as guards on the other side stirred, their keen senses alert to the disturbance. After a tense moment, the guards moved on, and Senzorin seized the opportunity to try the door again. But fortune was not on his side; the door creaked once more, and the guards immediately snapped into a combat stance, their eyes scanning the area. 

Senzorin, realising he had to act quickly, whipped out his revolver and fired at one of the guards, but the close proximity threw off his aim, and the shot went wide, ricocheting off the wall with a sharp crack. Cursing under his breath, Senzorin lunged forward, swiftly knocking out the guard in the stairwell. He burst into the garage just in time to see another guard rushing toward the security console. He took careful aim again, pulling the trigger and knocking the guard out cold before taking stock of the situation.

In the centre of the garage, a large tarp covered a vehicle sitting in the middle of a glowing teleportation circle. Senzorin strode over and yanked the tarp aside, revealing the sleek lines of the Talos Sovereign beneath. Following Zel’eon’s instructions, he swiftly disconnected the engine block, the mechanics of the task almost instinctual as he shoved the precious cargo into his bag of holding. With the engine block secured, Senzorin darted back toward the fire exit, bounding up the steps with a sense of urgency. As he burst into the alleyway, he threw on the cloak of invisibility just in time to evade a surveillance crystal mounted near the door.

Zel’eon was waiting on Senzorin’s motorcycle, engine rumbling softly, a beacon of escape. He felt the rush of air as Senzorin landed on the back, and without hesitation, he revved the engine and sped off. The afternoon sun hung high above Ilrinia, casting a warm glow on the exhilarated duo as they raced home, laughter spilling from their lips, giddy with the thrill of their successful heist.
# XP
For their time spent preparing and eventual success in the heist, along with discovering their abilities during the combat class and making allies instead of enemies out of the Avjarn, the party gains 1000 experience points, bringing them from 3200xp to 4200xp.

# Session Recap
## Reconvening at the House
On Udis, the first day of the weekend, the sun hung low in the sky on the 27th of Mistfall, 1892, casting golden rays across the city of Ilrinia. Zel'eon and Senzorin returned to their home after their heist at the Platinum Tower. Senzorin, unable to contain his exhaustion any longer, collapsed onto the couch, the upholstery sinking beneath him.

Moments later, the front door swung open, and Arche stepped inside, her face revealing just how draining her evening had been. She had recently returned from a date with Jack, a student from Miskatonic University, and it was evident that the outing had not gone as she had hoped. Without a second thought, she sank down beside Senzorin on the couch, who shifted slightly but offered her no words of comfort.

From upstairs, the sounds of studying drifted down the hallway as Saziver remained deep into his exam preparations. Zel’eon called for him and moments later, Saziver appeared at the top of the staircase, his eyes wide from the countless energy drinks he had consumed today. He slowly walked down the stairs, joining the rest in the living room.

As Arche recounted her evening with Jack, a realization dawned on her friends. She kept calling him "just a friend," revealing that she hadn’t fully grasped that it was indeed a date. The atmosphere shifted as playful teasing erupted, heating Arche's cheeks with embarrassment in response to their reactions.

Zel'eon and Senzorin talked about what they had been up to, describing the events of their heist. As they spoke, Saziver’s expression grew anxious at the recklessness of their actions. The two young men also told the rest of the team about their most recent sparring session, where, surprisingly, they had discovered they had some latent magical abilities.

Curiosity piqued, Saziver demanded a demonstration. Senzorin obliged, pulling out his revolver and showing it was unloaded by popping out its bullet cylinder. As he concentrated, lines of runic energy began to swirl around the barrel, coalescing into a flickering bolt of elemental fire at the tip. It shot forth from the weapon, illuminating the room in flickering light, much to the astonishment of Arche and Saziver. 

They were previously aware of his limited telekinesis and telepathy which seemed incongruent with his new ability. Saziver’s mind, still in study mode, suggested the revolver might be enchanted or some kind of magitech. Senzorin simply shrugged, stating, “I just shoot the damn thing.” Arche chimed in, noting that Senzorin would save a fortune on bullets, before asking about the origins of the weapon. He explained that it had been a gift from his mentor, Einrow, just before his death as a result of stealing the revolver.

At this point, Zel’eon proposed they set to work replacing the engine of their vintage Talos Sovereign with the one they had liberated from Victor Ralston’s vehicle. Saziver eagerly accepted, exclaiming that he was the perfect height to pass him tools.

Entering the garage, they surveyed their two vehicles: the dilapidated Talos Sovereign, a remnant of their hurried escape from Mosskach, and Senzorin's pride, his chopper previously owned by Einrow. Zel'eon set to work on the engine while Saziver assisted, and Arche invoked a spell of guidance to bolster their efforts. At last, the engine roared to life, probably for the first time in decades.

The four of them piled into the newly restored Talos, while Senzorin took to his motorcycle. Setting out for an early dinner, they emerged onto the suburban streets of Arbalest, where the neighbourhood's families milled about, enjoying the weekend.

As they sped down the road, Senzorin spotted Ellipses in his garden and couldn’t resist shouting, “Where's my plants?” before they rode off. Senzorin suggested dining at the Iron Horse Tavern, but Arche playfully threatened to cast Purify Food and Drink on his beers, rendering them non-alcoholic. Senzorin’s retort came swiftly: “I’ll beat your motherfucking ass under the table.” In the end, they settled on Tom’s Diner in Greenwich.
## Tom's Diner
The group soon pulled into a quaint cul-de-sac where a classic diner stood out, its vibrant red and white decor gleaming with a simple sign that read: **Tom’s Diner**.

Settling into a booth, the aroma of fried chicken and waffles enveloped the group. They ordered their meals from the sleek touchscreens embedded within the table, but were interrupted as Senzorin’s gaze landed on a familiar sight across the diner. There sat Jonathan Ralston, a boy Senzorin was dating, and Jack—Arche’s unremarkable "date"—with two other Miskatonic University students.

Jonathan’s laughter filled the air, each chuckle laced with confidence, his long black hair cascading over his sharp, preppy features as he joked with his companions. In stark contrast, Jack sat uneasily, an average-looking figure overshadowed by Jonathan's charisma, seemingly lost in thoughts of their earlier encounter with Arche. With them were two half-elf women: a blonde with emerald green eyes who spoke animatedly with Jonathan, and a black-haired girl with East Asian features who observed quietly.

“Isn’t that your friend?” Senzorin teased, a sly grin breaking across his face as he looked at Arche. At the same moment, Saziver began to notice an odd expression on Arche’s face—one that suggested she was not entirely forthcoming about her date with Jack.

In a bid to reclaim some dignity amidst the teasing, she said, “Well, he did drop an ‘I love you’ during our outing.” As her words hung in the air, incredulity washed over her friends, their expressions morphing into a mixture of surprise and humor. “Who does that?” she exclaimed, throwing her hands up in exasperation.

Just then, Senzorin saw the group glancing over in their direction. “Jonathan looks kind of good, though...” making Arche shoot daggers at him. Saziver, who had turned his attention to the other table, caught the blonde half-elf leaning in close to Jack. “Isn’t that the girl who kept calling you a friend?” she whispered. Amused, Saziver stifled a giggle as he continued to read their lips.

Jack, embarrassed, began recounting the outing to Jonathan and their friends. “I brought her to this fancy place,” he said, a hint of despair creeping into his voice, “but she just kept saying it was the best friend outing ever.” 

Suddenly, Arche turned to catch sight of Jack and his friends staring at them. A rush of unfathomable embarrassment coursed through her, and in a desperate attempt to escape, she cast a spell to teleport out to the Talos, parked just outside the diner. The rest of her friends glanced out the window in confusion, quickly spotting Arche, now awkwardly crunched in the backseat, her cheeks flushed.

At this, Zel’eon and Senzorin got up to approach Jack and his companions. Saziver's eyes widened in alarm, but the pair paid no mind to him. Senzorin made a beeline for Jonathan calling out to him, “Hey, John,”. Jonathan’s face brightened, as the half-elf girls giggled at their interaction, clearly aware of the pair's recent history.

Jack was trying his best to sink into the cushions of the booth, but Zel’eon leaned around Jonathan and greeted him. He introduced himself to the group, getting the names of Jack's friends: Gemma, the blonde, and K'Lai, the dark-haired girl. 

Before long, Zel’eon casually mentioned the date with Arche, prompting the color to drain from Jack's face. Jack grew more and more uncomfortable as Zel'eon and Senzorin began telling him he dodged a bullet with Arche, describing their friend as weird and schizophrenic.

Redirecting the conversation, Jonathan turned to Senzorin, inviting him out for drinks with his group later that evening. Not wanting to commit to any plans, Senzorin deflected the invitation, promising he would send a text later. 

After the brief exchange, Zel’eon, Saziver, and Senzorin wandered back out to the car where Arche awaited. “You better stay away from boys from now on,” Senzorin teased her. “You’re not just a heartbreaker; you’re a soulbreaker!”

Amidst the ribbing, Zel’eon received a text from Dalen Blackwell regarding a meeting to discuss his newfound magical ability as an artificer. Though Dalen was a bit older—roughly in his mid-thirties—his messaging contained contemporary Gen Z slang that sent a wave of amusement through the group.

As they pulled away from the diner under the soft glow of the fading sun, they decided to head to Arbalest Academy for some sparring before returning home.
## Zel'eon and Arche Spar
As the evening sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the field behind Arbalest Academy in hues of orange and purple, the group arrived for Zel'eon and Arche's spar. Senzorin and Saziver set up lawn chairs as Zel'eon and Arche prepared for combat.

Arche stood ready, her black mask and form-fitting mithril bodysuit glimmering eerily beneath the emerging moonlight. Zel'eon dressed simply in a white shirt and black pants, forgoing his usual jacket. 

With a sudden burst of energy, Zel'eon extended his wings wide, the metal glinting in the moonlight just before he lunged forward, arm blade slashing across Arche’s chest, leaving a sheet of frost spreading out from the rent in her clothing. Arche sprang back, her left hand raised as a spear of pure moonlight coalesced within her grip, radiating a soft, ethereal glow.

Saziver leaned forward in his chair, eyes alight with excitement, while Senzorin's attention was focused on a lone janitor who had paused his cleaning duties to watch the fight.

Arche lunged forward, attacking Zel'eon twice—first with her sword and then with the conjured spear. The clang of metal against steel echoed as Zel'eon was pushed back, but he quickly regained his footing, extending his right wing to stabilize himself. He retaliated with a sweeping strike, his arm blade trailing wisps of ice through the air. 

Arche wasn’t deterred. This time, she pierced forward with her spear, the tip aimed directly at Zel’eon’s chest. The weapon struck true, driving into him. He grunted in pain but did not retreat; instead, he gripped the spear’s haft, pulling himself closer while extending his free hand toward her.

With a crackle of blue electricity, Zel'eon touched Arche's armored plating, causing arcs of energy to leap from him to her. The jolting current forced her to recoil with a gasp. Dropping her sword, she clenched her fist, gathering white moonlight within it.

Stepping forward, she struck Zel'eon squarely in the face, the force of her punch lifting him clean off the ground. He flew backward, landing heavily.

Shock washed over Arche as she realized the impact of her blow. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry, what the fuck?” she exclaimed, rushing to his side. 

“That was sick as fuck!” Saziver cackled, filling the air with his exuberant cheer from the sidelines.

Quickly, Arche knelt beside Zel'eon, her hands hovering over him as she began to invoke her healing magic. The air glimmered as she channeled her energy, urging him back to consciousness. 

As they brought Zel'eon to the infirmary, the group made use of one of the EchoTech MediPods—a magitech device with the ability to diagnose and heal injuries almost instantaneously. Arche’s apologies kept coming as Senzorin chuckled, “Don’t be sorry; he did this to me last week.”

While the machine pulsed with healing energy, Zel'eon gazed out the window, watching the janitor cleaning away the remnants of their spirited sparring match. Thoughts whirled in his mind as he analyzed the battle, questioning where he had faltered. He recognized that some foes, like Arche, would boast formidable physical defenses, and he would need to diversify his combat skills to counter such challenges in the future.

At that moment, Senzorin's phone chimed, breaking his concentration. He glanced at the screen and saw it was a call from Jonathan. He considered the invitation to join them briefly before deciding, “I’ll go ahead.” 

As the others began to head home, Senzorin mounted his chopper, heading towards Greenwich to join Jonathan and his friends once more.
## Senzorin joins the Miskatonic University Students for Drinks
Heading back to Greenwich, Senzorin soon found himself within the cozy confines of a dimly lit bar, accompanied by Jonathan and the others: Jack, Gemma, and K'lai.

Jonathan stayed glued to Senzorin's side the entire night as Senzorin learned more about their respective studies. Jonathan detailed his newfound love of arbormancy, the study of magical botany—a field he had initially embraced to follow in his father's footsteps as an executive at Sylvan Corporation. Jack talked about studying combat magic as he explained his aspirations to become a spellsword, while Gemma described her relatively obscure field of arithmancy, a field of study that explored the relationship between mathematics and magic. K’lai, who studied divine magic at the university, talked about the rise of rates of Aasimar in Ilrinia—a trend she speculated was linked to the city's position on a convergence of leylines.

"The Council of Arcaneum established itself here centuries ago for precisely that reason," K’lai stated, explaining how this intersection of leylines made Ilrinia a crucible for powerful magic.

An odd sensation flickered within Senzorin's mind as he listened, nudging some dormant memory toward the surface. He recalled, though drunkenly, tales from his childhood hinting at the Council's founding being shrouded in a more sinister mystery—some incident long forgotten. A piece of knowledge that, like the fragmented memories of his life before he ran away to Mosskach, remained out of reach.

The waning night saw the group gradually dispersing, and eventually, Senzorin found himself departing with Jonathan, as they staggered towards the Platinum Tower.

Arriving at the Ralston penthouse, Senzorin hesitated momentarily at the threshold. His heart quickened as he caught sight of Jonathan’s father, Victor Ralston, reclined comfortably on the couch. 

Victor turned to greet them, his expression welcoming as he remarked on Senzorin’s cowboy hat, which had settled askew atop his head. There was something about Victor’s face that caught Senzorin’s eye, an odd flicker of something concealed beneath the surface, but it was quickly overshadowed when Senzorin turned to Jonathan and saw the boy giving him strong bedroom eyes. Senzorin felt a smile spread across his face, and he didn’t resist as Jonathan beckoned him up to his room.
## Downtime
Over the next two weeks, the group went through a period of relative calm, taking the opportunity to work on their own pursuits.

As discussed, Zel'eon met Dalen Blackwell at his office, learning more about what Artificers are able to do. Dalen highlighted potential pathways for improvement, fuelling Zel'eon's determination for more ways to improve himself.

Senzorin seized the opportunity to develop his relationship with Jonathan Ralston; he spent most of the nights together with Jonathan, either at his penthouse or in Senzorin's own room.

Arche spent some time at the National Library going through the free archival course, accompanied by the courses other attendants, who Arche found happened to be from all walks of life and all ages - a testament to the Ilrinian drive for self-improvement.

Saziver continued studying hard for his upcoming examinations, focusing on his chosen subject combination of engineering mathematics, business and finance, basic elvish, technomancy, and psionics, the last of which he spent a day each week training under the Arbalest Academy principal, John de Bolbec. 

Turning her gaze to the sky every night, Arche wondered how she could spread word of Ruatis among the populace. Briefly considering printing out flyers to put up around the city, she had a flash of inspiration - if she could reconnect with her estranged father, the governor of Ilrinia, she could lean on his political power to spread the word of her god. With this in mind, she enlisted Saziver to help research her father, finding out that he was up for re-election soon, and planned to hold a rally on the 12th of Lunaris.

Zel'eon also decided to work on enhancing the newly restored Talos Sovereign, kitting it out with reupholstered leather seating and a seat warming system. He borrowed Saziver and the pair worked on an autopiloting navigation system, managing to install a tablet into the central console that could extend a cable that plugged into a port Zel'eon implanted on his body, to give him the ability to control the car without having to drive it manually. Though the autopilot function did not get finished just yet, Zel'eon planned on submitting it as a final year project in his design and technology class.

Senzorin also spent some time building a relationship with Ilrinia's underworld elements, making his face known to the Thieves' Guild.

Zel'eon also decided to lean on Senzorin's criminal connections and his own research, finding a potential pit fighting club, patronised mainly by the rich and powerful, hidden within a small warehouse in Ham Row.

Senzorin, not wanting his combat capabilities to fall to the wayside during this period, trained hard at increasing his prowess, focusing on trying to use the magitech revolver more efficiently. He discovered his ability to use it to cast fire, ice, or lightning elemental bolts, and recognised these base elements as being building blocks to potentially cast even more damaging effects through the gun.

Saziver, in his studies with Principal de Bolbec, found that he seemed to not be a powerful psion (like Saziver had the potential to be) himself, but still knew how to train one. Saziver began practising how to read an enemy's mind and body language to predict what they were going to do next.

Throughout this period, Zel'eon, still reminded of his loss against Arche, began plans to install sub-dermal armor plating to enable him to fight more offensively. Recognising the best material to him at the moment, steel, would still be sub-par compared to orichalcum, he decided to wait until he was able to procure some. 

Arche also joined the rest in training her combat skills, practising every night under the moon on using her spear in tandem with her sword and her magic. She began to think on how she could develop her worship of Ruatis even more with her combat, coming up with plans to manufacture a tip for her collapsible elven spear out of moon rock.

Zel'eon also set to work understanding the recipes he had taken from the Purists' offices, eventually finding out how to manufacture alchemists' fire in his lab. He created a few vials of this, loading it into his arm launcher to prepare for any fights ahead. Additionally, he began research on trying to create a sonic bomb that could fit into his arm launcher.
## Arche's Birthday Celebration
The sun crept over the horizon on Ruatis, the 12th of Lunaris, 1892, spilling golden light into the cozy confines of Arche's small bedroom. Arche stirred beneath her covers, blinking groggily at the reality that struck her like a bolt of pure magic—today was her birthday! But as the realization washed over her, a shadow crept into her heart. Memories surged like waves at high tide, flooding her mind with visions of laughter, of decorated cakes, and of parents who had once cherished this day. For a fleeting moment, she felt the weight of a decade's worth of missed celebrations.

Slipping out from the cocoon of her blankets, Arche stretched, her blue moon pajamas striking a playful contrast against the muted hues of her room. Glancing around, she took in her surroundings: her double bladed sword leaning against the wall, her armored bodysuit draped across a chair, and the plastic gun, made for her by Zel'eon, sitting on her desk. Blinking the sleep from her eyes, she padded down the staircase, as the morning sun streamed through the windows of the stairwell.

As she descended, a sudden choir of voices caught her off guard. Her friends had gathered to serenade her, singing her happy birthday loudly and off-key. In the center of it all stood Saziver proudly bearing a cake shaped like the moon. 

The unmistakable sound of a door creaking open echoed from above, and a box floated down the staircase, suspended by Senzorin's telekinesis, coming to a stop in front of Arche.

She unwrapped the box, and saw Senzorin's present for her: a disco ball-sized steel full moon,  forged by Senzorin in the forges of the Avjarn. Tears misted Arche's eyes as she reached out to pat Senzorin's head, her gratitude spilling into words. “Thank you.” Overcome by emotion, she dashed back upstairs, securing the moon above her bed.

Next up was a rectangular box from Zel'eon, carefully wrapped and waiting eagerly for her touch. Inside lay an ornamental rapier, also crafted in the Avjarn's forges, bearing the elvish symbol of the moon. Zel'eon cautioned her against using it for combat, but Arche thanked him nonetheless, stating that it was beautiful.

Saziver decided to finish the celebration with his own gift for Arche. “Do you have your tablet with you?” he asked, his fingers already dancing over the screen of his own device. Arche nodded, not knowing what to expect. A moment later, her own tablet vibrated, and she discovered Saziver had crafted an entire new lunar theme. She saw that Saziver had added widgets showcasing the moon's phases and little moon icons for each of her apps.

Once the cake was devoured, the atmosphere shifted. Arche cleared her throat, her smile fading slightly as she glanced at her friends. “I might need your help with something later,” she began, telling them about the rally for Anderson Ortlinde for his upcoming gubernatorial re-election. She planned to use this public appearance to reconnect with her estranged father.

Obviously, her friends agreed to help her, accompanying her to the rally, which was to be held after school. After a quick breakfast, the group headed to school, planning to meet straight afterwards at the rally.
## Arriving at the Rally
The afternoon sun shone over the Ortlinde Youth Home, where Anderson Ortlinde, the governor of Ilrinia and Arche's estranged father, was set to address the public in a rally for his re-election. As the team approached the venue, dressed far more formally than their typical combat gear, Zel’eon led the pack, clad in a crisp white jacket, with white plating fitted snugly over his prosthetic,s and simple black trousers over combat boots. Beside him, Senzorin wore a tailored suit, complete with a sharp black tie, yet still keeping his signature cowboy hat and trench coat.

Arche’s heart raced as she adjusted her own suit, a pair of sunglasses and a mask concealing her face—a precaution against being recognised by her father. Meanwhile, Saziver, wearing a three-piece navy suit almost too large for his small frame, stood with an anxious energy, glancing back at the throng of supporters already gathering outside. Street vendors already filled the area, hawking wares and street food.

The youth home’s front was adorned with two large banners emblazoned with "Vote Ortlinde!" above a stylized depiction of the governor—a pale elf with jet-black hair and vaguely Caucasian features, staring out with a warm smile. As they stepped into the building, they were met with a expansive multipurpose hall, packed with attendees. Bright sunlight streamed through the wide glass windows, illuminating the faces of eager citizens, many of whom cheerfully waved signs in support of the governor. A stage stood at the far end, a lectern waiting for its occupant.

A tremor of anxiety crept into Arche’s heart. She turned to her friends, her voice a whisper in the crowded hall. "Guys, I'm kind of getting second thoughts." The group shared concerned glances, briefly discussing various strategies to facilitate a private meeting with the governor, including the possibility of sending a message or keeping Arche hidden in the car. Yet, the consensus was to withstand the overwhelming tide of the gathering, deciding they would not disrupt the event.

Taking a more proactive stance, Saziver activated his AR glasses and began typing fervently, immersed in the virtual interface of his own design. The others form a circle around Saziver, trying to shield him from prying eyes as he types away, thoroughly absorbed in his task.

Saziver quickly succeeded in breaching the building’s security systems and accessed the surveillance crystals, flicking through the various camera feeds. As he scrutinized the crowd, an observation came to mind—an unusually high proportion of wood elves filled the hall. Where he would expect a mere 1%, nearly 10% of the rally attendees appeared to be wood elves, clad in ill-fitting suits.

He flipped his screens to the backstage feed. There, he saw Governor Ortlinde standing beside his wife, Aurora Ortlinde—Arche's mother. Sitting in a wheelchair, Aurora was beautiful even in her stillness, her bright blonde hair and golden skin dreamlike even in the darkness backstage. Yet, she sat utterly motionless, unresponsive to her husband gently patting her back.

Governor Ortlinde, nominally a sun elf, looked odd with his black hair, pale skin, and grey eyes, thought the group was used to such features from Arche. He was clad in a bright blue three-piece suit - the colors affiliated with the Council of Aenyrathia. Saziver tried to reach out psionically to sense Aurora’s emotional state; however, the distance hindered his abilities. Yet, he manages to make a faint connection through the video feed, and managed to make a tenuous connection.

Suddenly, despair flooded his senses. Aurora’s psyche radiated a suffocating darkness, an impenetrable void of depression that enveloped a core of tightly locked emotions. Overcome by this powerful rush, Saziver felt a tear escape his eye as he withdrew from her mind, revealing his findings to the group with a shaky voice.

Arche’s expression darkened as she nodded slowly, tears brimming in her eyes, explaining how her mother had been in this state since her brother was kidnapped a decade ago, "She completely withdrew from everything, stopped talking to me or my dad—even not eating or drinking anything for a while.” The group offered assurances that all would be well when Arche talked to her, but Arche remained doubtful that her mother would even react to her.

As they continued to monitor the feed, Saziver saw a sun elf woman who approached Governor Ortlinde backstage, her words inaudible. The governor responded with a nod, adjusted his tie, and soon stepped out of sight.

The team shifted their attention back to the stage as Governor Ortlinde emerged to a round of applause. The hall lit up with camera flashes as the clamor of reporters begin to rise. Raising his hand, he called for silence, flashing his signature smile.

“Citizens of Ilrinia. It is a pleasure to see you once again. I welcome you to the start of this race for re-election that I am participating in once again. I hope you have enjoyed my first term. I have reduced homelessness, improved education, provided free lunches to every child in Ilrinia, and opened this beautiful place,” he gestured expansively toward the Youth Home, eliciting a wave of cheers and applause from the audience.

Saziver noticed something alarming: among the applause, only the wood elves stood motionless, remaining still in their ill-fitting suits, a stark contrast to the jubilation around them.

As Governor Ortlinde continued his address, informing the citizens of his dedication to their well-being, Saziver observed one of the lion-maned wood elves standing close to them reach into his pocket. The elf’s action was mirrored by the others, who began to produce small glass spheres filled with a swirling, ominous mist, putting on face masks with their free hands.

Panic gripped Saziver as he quietly tells the group what is happening and to get ready. 

All at once, the wood elves shattered their orbs with a sharp, resonant crack, releasing a noxious green gas that began to coil around their feet, slowly spreading throughout the hall; and the team leapt into action.
## Serendipity
The lion-maned wood elf, his expression resolute, prepared to crush the glass sphere in his grasp. Just as his fingers tightened, ready to unleash the gas, Saziver Copper-Fern acted. The nervous energy thrumming through him surged towards the elf, and he reached into the depths of the wood elf's mind, grasping it tightly, and wrung it like a sponge. Saziver leapt forward, snatching the glass sphere from the elf’s hand before it could shatter. The wood elf looked dumbly at his empty palm as panic swept through the hall.

Around them, the other wood elves each shattered glass spheres of their own. The gas began to spread like wildfire among the unsuspecting crowd, who choked and clutched at their throats, some collapsing to the ground, faces contorted in shock and horror. Desperation ignited in Zel’eon Talos’ heart. Swiftly discarding his jacket, he spread his metal wings wide, glinting in the light. With a mighty flap, he summoned a gust of wind that pushed the gas away, offering a brief reprieve to those nearest him. But as he gazed at the gas curling up against the tightly sealed windows, he understood that this was merely a temporary solution; if an escape route for both the gas and the civilians wasn't created soon, the hall would become a tomb.

And so Zel'eon aimed his arm cannon, its electronic circuitry harmonizing with his intent, and fired a ball bearing at one of the windows. The glass shattered and a few dazed citizens leaned out, gasping for the fresh air that escaped into the ether. But still, more were falling. He glanced back to see yellow runic barriers emerge around the hall brought forth by Council mages, garbed in deep blue gilded robes, straining under the effort of maintaining such a protective radius. They shouted frantically, urging the frightened attendees to shelter within.

Senzorin Talos navigated the throng of panicked citizens like a shadow. Making a beeline for Governor Ortlinde, he evaded the gas that threatened to choke and disable him. As he weaved through the crowd, so did his bullets, eliciting soft thuds as he slew the terrorists where they stood around the hall.

As graceful as moonlight, Arche Kagekiyo slew two of the terrorists with spear through the chest before they even noticed her, making her way to the exit doors. Noticing the poison gas creeping up by the exit, threatening to block it off for the civilians, she withdrew her ceramic gun and placed it against her temple, eyes closed. Pulling the trigger, the people surrounding her watched in shock and awe as white crystal shards exploded from the wound, and Arche's eyes snapped open, glowing pure silver. A massive sphere of moonlight erupted out from her, surrounding the civilians and negating the effects of the poison gas. "Who... Who are you?" a stunned spectator finally asked. “Arche Kagekiyo,” she proclaimed, her voice resonating with strength amid the wreckage, “High Priestess of Ruatis.”

Saziver's mind-control still gripped the first wood elf, pressing him with, "Why are you attacking us?", hoping to find some reason for this attack. "Well, you guys killed a patron-beast!" the elf replied, a dopey grin plastered on his face, oblivious to the gravity of his words.

As Governor Ortlinde stood surrounded by two bodyguards at the front of the hall, five wood elf terrorists descended, their intentions clear as they bore down upon him. As Senzorin made his way towards the governor, the terrorists took down one of the bodyguards, forcing the governor to engage with two of the terrorists directly.

Divorcing himself from the melee, Zel’eon took flight. He focused on shattering the remaining windows, generating wind with each flap of his wings. As he smashed each pane of glass, he felt the wind pick up as the Council mages rallied behind him, their spells tearing a rent in the gas wide enough for the civilians to escape.

Saziver continued pressing his charmed wood elf, but at the sight of some poison gas spreading towards them, the charmed elf widened his eyes in surprise, grabbing Saziver and leaping out of a nearby window.

As all the window panes stood broken and shattered, so did the morale of the wood elf terrorists as they watched the poison gas leak out of the hall. Growling, they turned to the governor and began moving toward him, at least trying to achieve their secondary objective of assassinating him. Alas, some of them would never reach the governor alive, as Senzorin shot them in the back, they fell slain to the floor of the Ortlinde Youth Home, as Senzorin stepped over their bodies to help the governor and his remaining bodyguard fend off the remaining attack.

At the front of the hall, Arche still defended the escaping civilians, emanating a silvery glow as a wood elf terrorist rushed up to disable her. With a hand, Arche reached out and tapped her on his shoulder, and she stepped back with a look of fear on her face as black veins spread throughout her body. Arche hears a voice in her mind, sounding like pure moonlight. She watches as the wood elf's body swells, and she heard Ruatis tell her: "Happy birthday, dear.", as the terrorist's body implodes into black goo.

Zel'eon took off towards the governor at top speed, noting Senzorin dispatching three of the remaining terrorists alongside the governor's bodyguard. He landed behind one of the remaining terrorists engaging the governor directly, and drew their ire by slashing at them with his arm blade, drawing a nod of gratitude from Governor Ortlinde.

As the terrorist in front of Governor Anderson Ortlinde lunged forwards, teeth bared, he reacted by striking them in the nose with a powerful jab, but instead of letting the terrorist stumble back in pain, he grabbed them by the collar, pulling them back with his left hand and delivering an uppercut to the terrorist's chin with his right, sending a resounding CRK-CRACK! through the emptying hall.

Zel'eon immediately noted the similarity to Arche's finishing punch against him a couple of weeks ago, and decided to try it out himself. As he sheathed his arm blade with a thought, he gathered electric blue energy in his right fist, and slammed it into the remaining terrorist's face, knocking him out cold. The governor let out a low whistle showing his appreciation for the move and telling Zel'eon, "Nice one, son."

As a single solitary wood elf stood in the middle of the hall, realising he was the only one left alive, he steeled his jaw in resolution. He turned to face the fleeing citizens and aimed his pistol, trying to cause as much damage as possible before he went, but the gun's trigger would never depress. The elf reached up and grasped at his neck as he choked out his last breath, his neck frozen solid. Behind him, Senzorin aimed his revolver, this time firing a normal bullet as opposed to a bolt of ice, shattering the last terrorist's neck and sending his severed head arcing through the air.

As the chaos of the battle faded, the team looked around, not even bothering to celebrate their victory. They had triumphed, yes, yet around the hall lay a score of corpses belonging to the innocent; that they failed to save. Congregating at the front of the hall in front of the governor, Arche and her friends prepared to finally speak to her father.
## Luvia Bellona Ortlinde
As Saziver brought the charmed terrorist over to the governor, the rest of the group convened by the front of the hall. Arche shook with anxiety as Governor Ortlinde introduced himself to the group, and they responded in kind. They spoke briefly about the implications of the attack and the charmed wood elf's claim that one of their patron-beasts had been slain, before the governor's voice began to trail off as he stared directly at Arche. In a soft voice, he said, "Luvia?"

Zel'eon and Senzorin immediately slinked away as Anderson Ortlinde looked at his daughter in shock. "We thought you were dead... What happened? Why did you leave?"

Arche, called by her birth name for the first time in years, stood in front of her father, feeling reduced to a little girl again as Anderson's voice climbed higher and higher. "We thought you were dead, Luvia! How could you leave your mother?" With a soft voice, Arche only responded, "I don't know." Sighing, Anderson looked to the side. "How could you be like this?"

"Like what?" Arche shot back, incensed.

"I've stayed by her side this whole time!" 

"And has that helped? Have you tried doing anything differently?" 

"You know we have been looking for your brother for years!" 

"Yeah, and you didn't find anything, so I thought, hey! Maybe I could do something." 

"And did you succeed in that?"

"No," Arche softly whispered, ending the back-and-forth. Saziver stood there, paralyzed by anxiety as he observed the exchange between father and daughter. "Then what leave have you to say that about me?" the governor said softly. "Do you think I have not tried, do you think I have not cried every single day, thinking about where your brother might be?"

As experienced a combatant as Arche was, she was still a teenager, and so, in her youthful frustration, she lashed out, sullenly saying, "Well, you haven't exactly been a standout dad." Saziver squirmed beneath the palpable tension between the two elves, acutely aware of the emotions swirling in the air by virtue of his psionic abilities. "I'm sorry if I failed as a standout dad to you, but I've been busy," the governor said, "busy trying to take care of your mother, trying to find your brother. I thought you were good enough to stand on your own." Scoffing, Arche looked into her father's eyes. "So busy trying to find your missing child, you forgot about the one that was still around."

Anderson looked out across the empty hall, for his security detail had long left by now. "So what now? Do you wish to leave again, abandoning us? Abandoning your mother?" Upon not receiving a reply from Arche, he met her stare with one just as piercing as hers. "Why did you come here, Luvia? Why did you come to my rally?" Arche looked down at the floor, the tips of her ears burning with shame as her father realized why she had come to see him. "Ah," a deep look of sadness washed over the elder elf's features, "You're a chip off the old block, aren't you, Luvia?" Arche met her father's eyes once more. "I'm no different from you."

Anderson stood up, taking a slow step away from his daughter. "Why don't you go check on your mother? She'd be happy to see you." As Arche stepped backstage with Saziver, the governor approached Zel'eon and Senzorin, who were fervently attempting to act as though they hadn't heard anything. Looking at the crestfallen governor, Zel'eon's heart softened, and he spoke up, telling him not to be too hard on his daughter. As Zel'eon and Senzorin told him that they had taken care of her when she fled to Mosskach, a look of recognition crossed the governor's face as he regarded Senzorin, remembering him as the little Talos boy who had played with his daughter in their childhood, remarking on how he had grown.

Governor Ortlinde assured Senzorin that he would maintain discretion regarding his anonymity with the Talos clan, but said, "Speaking from your parents' perspective, I think you should reach out to them." Nevertheless, the governor expressed his gratitude to the two, telling them they would be amply rewarded for their assistance that day, leading them to request a selfie with him—a request he graciously agreed to.

Zel'eon sent the picture to Dalen immediately and received a flurry of question marks in response, followed by an avalanche of texts demanding an explanation. Among them was a message that simply read, "NVM. How the hell do you guys keep finding yourselves in these situations? On my way! now."

Meanwhile, Arche was backstage, kneeling before her mother. She spoke softly to Aurora, but, of course, there was no response. As the rest of the group filed in, they fell silent at the sight of Arche gently speaking to her mother, apologies spilling forth for having left. As the group assumed a solemn air and Arche fell into silence, simply gazing into her mother's face, Saziver got an idea.

Zel'eon observed silently as Saziver's expression transformed, displaying the unmistakable sign of him attempting to pull off a powerful psionic feat. He reached into the black void of the mindscape toward Aurora Ortlinde's mind, seeing it as a softly blinking light, appearing disordered and frayed.

He cradled her mind gently in his hand and tried everything he could think of to reach into it and pull Aurora out, but despaired at how tightly locked her psyche was behind her depression; until he noticed a tenuous link connecting Aurora's essence to a nearby shining star—Arche. Gathering the threads of memories binding their minds, that of years of happiness, heartbreak, and love, he amplified the connection, and to his elation, watched as the thread began to worm its way past the ironclad lock of her depression and reach into the core of her being.

As Arche, Zel'eon, and Senzorin stood there, still observing Aurora, a sudden movement caught their attention. For the first time in a very, very long time, Aurora Ortlinde's eyes focused on her hand resting in her lap, covered by Arche's. Her gaze traveled slowly up Arche's arm, finally fixing on her daughter's face as Arche began to sob with joy. With a slow, labored effort, Aurora's hand reached out, joints creaking from atrophy, as she placed it gently against Arche's cheek, whispering in an old, disused voice, "Luvia?"

As Saziver cleared his mind of the psionic mindscape, opening his eyes to witness Arche enveloping her mother in a warm embrace, sobbing and apologizing profusely, Aurora merely stroked her back, a weary smile gracing her lips. A presence approached, and Saziver turned toward the stage to see Anderson entering, wonder evident on his features. "Aurora?"

Arche turned to face him, tears and snot streaming down her cheeks. "Dad, mom's—Mom's responding again!" Anderson stood speechless, simply moving forward to wrap his wife and daughter in a heartfelt embrace. Zel'eon and Senzorin once again slinked away as Anderson began to apologize for treating his daughter so.

Meanwhile, as Zel'eon and Senzorin shared a cigarette outside the Ortlinde Youth Home, they noticed an Orcish-constructed car pull up on the street, from which Dalen Blackwell emerged. He asked for a full debrief, and after the pair recounted everything, he too took out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a deep drag. 

Inside, Anderson, Aurora, and Arche shared their experiences, each profusely apologizing for their past mistakes—Anderson for neglecting his daughter, Aurora for retreating into herself, and Arche for failing to understand her parents' pain. They promised to reunite as soon as possible, and Arche formally bid her family farewell as befit a member of House Ortlinde, with Saziver trotting at her heels.

As Arche and Saziver exited the Ortlinde Youth Home, they exchanged glances and, despite the gravity of the moments shared, exchanged grins. They climbed into their Talos Sovereign and started the drive home as the sun finally set on Arche's long and arduous birthday.
