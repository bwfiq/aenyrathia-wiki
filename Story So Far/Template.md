**Style Guide**:

1. **Structure**:
   - Start each section chronologically. Headings should clearly define each topic.
   - Include a 'TL;DR' section for quick comprehension.

2. **Characterization**:
   - Introduce players and characters with a brief background or defining traits.
   - Infuse character interactions with dialogue that fits their established personality.

3. **Descriptive Language**:
   - Use vivid and sensory language to create images in the readers’ minds.
   - Balance descriptions with actions to maintain pace during combat or suspense.

4. **World-Building**:
   - Introduce elements of the fantasy world organically—explain unique creatures, factions, and technologies through character interactions and plot developments.

5. **Tone and Style**:
   - Keep a conversational and immersive tone that reflects the collaborative storytelling style of RPG sessions.
   - Employ humour and emotional stakes to engage readers.

6. **Resolutions**:
   - Conclude sessions with character growth and meaningful outcomes, emphasizing their evolving relationships and future consequences of their actions.
