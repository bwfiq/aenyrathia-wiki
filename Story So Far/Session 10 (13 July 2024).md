# Session Recap
## Preparations
It's the 23rd of Mistfall 1892, and the group meets for breakfast, inviting Ellipses to join them. Zel'eon, Senzorin, Arche, and Ellipses fill Saziver in on the previous day's events, including the golem attack at the New Dawn lecture. They decide to follow up on Lyra Valen's invitation to her estate after their classes, hoping to find out what she wants from them.

Before heading to Lyra's estate, Ellipses helps Zel'eon de-rust the Talos Sovereign in their garage and attempts to add a skull to the front of Senzorin's motorcycle, which ends up looking more like a blob. The group stocks up on supplies, with Arche picking up a new rapier. They meet back at the house and head to Greenwich, where Lyra's estate is located.

Upon arrival, they are greeted by a large mansion in an affluent district. A mild-mannered butler welcomes them and brings them to a study in the back of the mansion, where Lyra sits. She greets them warmly and asks for their help in investigating the source of the golem attack from the previous night. She suggests they head to the Horizon Community Center to find any clues about who commandeered and sent the golem to kill her.
## Investigation
Worried the Council investigators wouldn't let them in, Zel'eon calls Dalen for access to the crime scene but hears the sounds of a firefight in the background of the call. Dalen agrees over the sound of a fireball exploding concerningly close to the handphone, and Zel'eon promptly hangs up. 

At the community centre, the security officer, a tall sun elf woman, directs them to the security room. On the second floor, Zel'eon and Saziver scrub through the security footage while Arche and Senzorin search a locked supply cabinet. Arche finds a false bottom with a blueprint of the security system marked with handwritten notes on vulnerabilities. Saziver finds no abnormalities in the footage, but Ellipses discovers a runestone inscribed with a rune of altered perception in the trash, indicating the footage had been magically tampered with.

Zel'eon notices an escape route on the blueprint leading to a vent on the roof. He unfurls his wings and flies straight up, crashing through a skylight. The rest of the group rushes downstairs to apologize to the inspector. Zel'eon finds nothing on the roof but notices a ladder leading to an alleyway, where he discovers a letter detailing the golem's location and assurances of the recipient's dedication to magical purity. He returns and hands the letter to the inspector, who identifies the seal of the Council being on the letter. The group takes pictures of the evidence before handing it over and leaves after thanking the inspector and apologising to her once again.

Arche searches the internet for information on groups dedicated to preserving magical purity and finds a website called the Pure Path, condemning technomancy. The site lists an address, and the group heads to the district of Ham Row. Senzorin sends his owl familiar to scout ahead, finding a dilapidated three-story office building. Saziver and Arche sneak to the back entrance while Zel'eon and Ellipses approach the front door.
## Assault
Zel'eon and Ellipses knock on the front door but receive no answer. As they step through, they trigger a trap that knocks them back, shattering the door. Two armed guards appear and point their crossbows at them. Hearing the commotion, Arche, Saziver, and Senzorin sneak in from the back and attack the guards, quickly dispatching them, but an arcane golem suddenly bursts through the ceiling, and arcane bolts fire down from above through the hole created by the golem. 

Ellipses, Arche, and Saziver head to the second floor to engage a few mages while Zel'eon and Senzorin take on the golem. After finishing off the golem, Zel'eon and Senzorin head upstairs to see the fight wrapping up, only to find Ellipses missing.

Ellipses had headed up the stairs to the third floor, finding a door that was left slightly ajar. He pulls it open, and is immediately attacked with two javelins. He sees two figures in the room, a spellcaster sitting calmly behind a desk, and a heavily armoured enforcer, wielding a longsword and a brace of javelins. As the rest of the group hears Ellipses get attacked upstairs, they head up and the group begins battle with Thibault Carroway, the leader of the Purists. 

Saziver incapacitates Thibault, taking over his mind as the rest of the group focus on taking down the enforcer. Ellipses, overcome by a terrifying might, unveils a frightening necrotic form, unfurling two metallic skeletal wings, causing the enforcer to run in fright. Zel'eon and Senzorin manage to dispatch him, and the group turn to Thibault. Ellipses, still in his terrifying visage, tells him to stand down, and Thibault sits back down behind his desk, defeated. 

They begin questioning him, trying to find out whether this group was involved in the golem attack on Ruatis. Thibault laughs, and although he does not outright say it, he reveals the Purists were not actually the ones who carried out the attack. The group, frustrated with his reticence, knock him out and begin carrying him downstairs, planning to bring him to Lyra.
